        "Text": "As the leaders of the world gather in Glasgow to discuss the fate of the climate crisis, the power to save the planet from destruction caused by humans does not only lie in the hands of those in power.While the majority of reductions in greenhouse gases will need to be accomplished by transformation in policy and industry, individual actions can also help prevent further warming, according to the experts.\"As individuals, we have to pursue collective action to actually move the needle on this,\" Jason Smerdon, a climate scientists for Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, told ABC News.This is what individuals can do to help slow down climate change, according to experts:Discuss climate change at the dinner tableRecent polling shows that global warming is \"one of those controversial subjects that don't get discussed at the dinner table,\" but according to Smerdon, that is a mistake.\"People often say that you shouldn't talk about religion or politics at the dinner table ... and that's a significant disadvantage,\" he said. \"People need to be discussing what it means for us individually, what it means for our communities, the regions where we live.\"Spencer Platt/Getty Images, FILEPeople dine outside at a restaurant at Bryant Park in Manhattan, May 4, 2021 in New York City.Smerdon encourages people who are educated and worried about the issue to talk to their loved ones and inner circles about what climate change would mean for them.Continue to talk about climate change to transform the culture and \"mobilize at the scale we need,\"

world's largest emitters are faring on climate goalsUse the power of the voteIt's up to the voter to put politicians in place to implement solutions already available, such as renewable energy, restoring ecosystems, practicing regenerative farming and making transportation greener, according to the experts.Actions taken during the Trump administration, such as the decision to roll back dozens of environmental protections and remove the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, as well as holding the Biden administration accountable on their promises, illustrate why it is so important to vote in every single election, Johnson said.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesPeople visit an early voting site at a YMCA in Brooklyn, Oct. 25, 2021 in New York.Lawmakers will need to address the structural deficiencies and ensure that climate legislation is passed and implemented swiftly, Smerdon said.\"The biggest, the most important things with regard to addressing climate change are addressing so many of the threats to our democracy that are unfolding currently in the United State,\" Smerdon said, adding that gerrymandering, the filibuster, the strong money lobby within politics and voter disenfranchisement are all \"real, serious impediments to passing climate change legislation.\"Carefully select who to do business withA relative few number of companies are responsible for an overwhelming percentage of the world's industrial greenhouse gas emissions, why it's important for consumers to know where they are putting their money, activists say.Just 100 companies worldwide are responsible for 71% of the world's industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a report by the non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project, published in 2017.It is important to \"look at the institutions that are financing and expanding and digging us more deeply in this climate hole,\" Lindsey Allen, executive director of the non-profit Rainforest Action Network, told ABC News.Carl

wallets to really increase the ambition of financial institutions with what the climate crisis demands,\" she said.In addition, donate time or spare cash to organizations dedicated to the fight against climate change, Johnson said.MORE: Eating sustainably is one of the easiest ways to combat climate change, experts sayEat sustainablyOn of the easiest thing individuals can do in their daily lives to make an impact in the climate fight is simple switches to their diets, according to experts.Individuals do not need to become a vegetarian or give up animal products altogether to reduce the carbon footprint of their meals.\"We're not turning them into vegans,\" Marty Heller, senior research specialist at the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems, told ABC News. \"We're just saying, hey, eat something that is an average [carbon] footprint.\"Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images, FILEA worker removes bugs from a trapping machine at a family farm in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China, Aug. 16, 2021. The farm has created truly organic rice by installing traps in the paddy fields to trap rice pests and using biological agents to control disease.The easiest way to make a meal more sustainable is to eat less meat and more organic, plant-based foods -- the closer they were grown, the better, according to the experts.Meat consumption is the largest culprit of greenhouse gas emissions in American diets. Individuals should cut back on beef consumption, which has a \"monumental\" carbon footprint compared to any other meat, Smerdon said.Individuals should also choose foods that are grown regeneratively, which restores carbon to the soil, \"where it belongs\" and plant trees and grow their own food, even if with just a small plot of land, Johnson said.MORE: Human-induced climate change may affect 85% of the global population, researchers sayWe can no longer wait on large changes from the federal governmentIndividuals will find more success addressing the impacts of climate change on their local communities rather than wait on the federal government to pass sweeping legislation, Smerdon said.Climate change is already here and impacted communities, as seen in the recent superstorms to hit the South and the wildfires burning in the drought-ridden West.Hotli Simanjuntak/EPA via ShutterstockYouth volunteers carry out a beach clean-up in Lamteungoh, Indonesia, Oct. 28, 2021.\"So we have to engage locally,\" he said. \"We have to engage our local networks, our local institutions, our local decision makers, to think about the impacts of climate change in our communities and make our communities more resilient and interconnected.\"MORE: What you can do to help prevent climate change, according to experts'Individual efforts only go so far'While there are several things people can do to reduce their carbon footprint, there are more reasons why placing the burden on individuals is \"simply not enough,\" Smerdon said.The guilt that people associate with the their carbon footprint and the carbon footprint of others is not actually helping to slow down global warming, he added.\"And when people start to feel guilty about what they are doing or not doing, it can lead to a sense of paralysis and a feeling of guilt that's not productive,\" Smerdon said.Toby Melville/ReutersAn electric car is charged at a roadside EV charge point, London, Oct. 19, 2021.Smerdon gave an example of the pandemic, and how it stalled the transportation sector across the globe in 2020.\"Despite all of the individual sacrifices that we made -- staying in our homes or apartments, not traveling, not going out much at all -- that made a very minimal dent in the overall emissions,\" he said. \"And so that really indicates that these are systemic characteristics of how we do business, how we create energy on the planet.\"",

        "Text": "Enbridge -- a private Canadian energy corporation -- has paid more than $2.9 million for law enforcement and public safety organization expenses related to the company's controversial Line 3 oil pipeline through a state-managed escrow account, according to documents obtained by ABC News through public records requests.The majority of the Enbridge money went toward more than $2 million in law enforcement wages for services such as conducting proactive patrols along the pipeline route and \"protecting the construction workers and equipment,\" according to the records.The account also reimbursed law enforcement hundreds of thousands of dollars for training, protective gear, transportation, hotel rooms, and meals while policing the pipeline, according to the records.\"If a state is openly in a financial relationship with a private actor, through an escrow account, where they are paying the police to protect their project, that should concern all of the public,\" Northern Minnesota-based tribal attorney and prominent Line 3 opponent Tara Houska told ABC News.ABC NewsPolice respond to members of a pipeline opposition camp during a \"direct action\" against the Line 3 pipeline.Enbridge strongly refutes the concept that they have turned local Minnesota police into a private security force, or that they had any control at all over how the account was spent.MORE: Opponents of Line 3 pipeline say project threatens Biden's climate legacy\"The escrow account was created by the state of Minnesota through the Public Utility Commission,\" Enbridge Chief Communications Officer Mike Fernandez told ABC News. \"All we were asked to do was contribute money to that escrow account. We make no judgments about how that money is spent. It was a condition of us actually getting the permit in order to operate.\"\"The judgments are all made by professionals in the state of Minnesota that have law enforcement backgrounds, and they are the ones that make judgments on the specific payments,\" Fernandez said.The thousand-mile-long Line 3 pipeline transports Canadian tar sands oil -- a high-emissions fossil fuel often described as the world's dirtiest oil -- through indigenous lands and waters, including the vulnerable headwaters of the Mississippi River.The project has been the target of multiple court battles and a years-long massive civil disobedience campaign led by indigenous women in Minnesota. Opposition to the controversial project has resulted in nearly 900 arrests, including dozens around the U.S. Capitol earlier this month.ABC NewsA member of a pipeline opposition camp is arrested in front of a pipeline facility during a \"direct action\" against the Line 3 pipeline.A spokesperson for the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission -- the state agency that oversees the escrow account -- wrote in a statement to ABC News that they had established the account \"because pipeline projects in other parts of the country have sometimes resulted in added burdens to law enforcement and social service agencies.\"\"The Commission appointed an independent Escrow Account Manager to evaluate all reimbursement requests and approve those requests that comply with the terms of the permit,\" PUC spokesperson Will Seuffert wrote.Enbridge has deposited at least $4.25 million into the account, according to the PUC's general counsel, Ryan Barlow.MORE: Line 3 pipeline resistance continues as activists ask Biden admin to shutdown projectMara Verheyden-Hilliard, director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund and an attorney representing pipeline opponents, told ABC News that the arrangement with Enbridge is an \"extraordinary set-up where the corporation is paying limitless funds into an account shared by multiple sheriff's departments across the state.\"\"This creates a new structure that fundamentally will distort any pretense of public policing in America and will be very dangerous to fundamental democratic principles,\" she said.Records show that at times during the Line 3 project, law enforcement billed the escrow account specifically for officers' time related to surveillance of pipeline opposition groups. One police department had wages reimbursed for an officer maintaining \"mobile surveillance on multiple believed rally participants\" in March, after he followed several cars believed to be occupied by pipeline opponents. The reimbursement requests also include references to \"stationary patrols\" near known pipeline opposition camps that were \"observed\" and \"monitored.\"One county sheriff's reimbursement request states their deputies' duties were to \"protect the construction workers and equipment.\" Numerous requests describe the officers' duties as providing \"pipeline security\" or \"drill site security.\" Some police supervisors also met with Enbridge officials \"to discuss project work areas, safety concerns, calls for service, intelligence gathering and public safety initiatives for the day,\" according to multiple reimbursement requests.Enbridge also designed and conducted numerous training exercises with local law enforcement, according to documents first obtained by The Intercept. The documents also show that public officials shared intelligence with Enbridge, such as a list of attendees at a pipeline opposition meeting.Multiple law enforcement agencies who were paid from the escrow account, as well as the Northern Lights Task Force, an umbrella organization of law enforcement agencies along the pipeline route, declined to be interviewed for this story and did not respond to requests for comment.ABC NewsMembers of a pipeline opposition camp participate in a \"direct action\" against the Line 3 pipeline.However, National Association of Police Organizations Executive Director Bill Johnson told ABC News that the arrangement with Enbridge is not alarming.\"This is in an effort to address realistic safety concerns that arise from the type/location/size of the business/event,\" Johnson said. \"Employers typically make payment not directly to the individual officers working the event, but to the governmental or other agency responsible for assigning/providing the officers.\"Among the group of nearly 70 local law enforcement and public safety agencies, the Cass County Sheriff's Office received the most money from the escrow account: more than $900,000 as of Oct. 1. The sum accounts for more than 13% of their budget for 2020. Most of the money was for deputies' wages, including overtime, incurred during \"proactive patrols\" of the pipeline route. The reimbursement requests also note that the sheriff's \"quick response to resolve issues has been successful in keeping the project moving\" and that Enbridge employees \"have been extremely appreciative of our efforts.\"One request includes reimbursement for a three-night stay at a $727-per-night \"beach resort\" for two \"extra deputies\" -- in a suite that accommodates 12 people and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms.The Cass County Sheriff's Office declined to be interviewed for this report and did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Public Utilities Commission wrote that \"accommodations reserved were based on available supply in the areas, with more expensive lodging being needed where there was a shortage of available lodging.\"\"Those relationships should be deeply concerning for any person ... regardless of where you sit on a pipeline issue,\" Tara Houska told ABC News. \"There should be a separation between private interests and the state.\"On July 29, Houska and members of her pipeline opposition group attempted to enter an active drilling site and were met by officers from multiple law enforcement agencies. A police report included in an escrow account reimbursement noted that flashbangs and other nonlethal munitions were deployed against the group as they attempted to enter the site and halt the pipeline from being drilled under the Red River.ABC NewsTara Houska, a tribal attorney of Couchiching First Nation, is seen during a \"direct action\" to halt construction of the Line 3 pipeline.Houska recalled \"being shot at with rubber bullets and mace at point-blank range. People's heads were bleeding.\"  She said she was struck multiple times by rubber bullets that produced scars that remain to this day.\"It was a nightmare, you know, to see that, to see police officers protecting this giant sci-fi drill that's going underneath this river,\" Houska said.Enbridge paid for the officers' wages, transportation, and meals to protect the drill site that day -- and many others. Law enforcement did not request reimbursement for the munitions they fired, but Enbridge did pick up the tab for the officers' meals, which included chicken wings, burgers, and nachos, according to receipts.The Wright County Sheriff's office, whose deputies were among the law enforcement present that day and wrote an accompanying incident report, did not respond to a request for comment.ABC News' Patrick Linehan contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "This report is a part of \"Rethinking Gun Violence,\" an ABC News series examining the level of gun violence in the U.S. -- and what can be done about it.The U.S. was gripped by two public health crises in 2020: the COVID-19 pandemic and a historic rise in gun violence.Even as cities locked down, people retreated into their homes and life was seemingly put on pause last year, 2020 still marked the deadliest year for gun violence in at least two decades, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).There were more than 19,400 homicides involving a gun and accidental fatal shootings -- a 25% increase from 2019, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. Gun suicides reached 24,000 last year, matching the year prior.Experts say it's not easy to identify one precise reason for the rise in gun violence.MORE: America has a gun violence problem. What do we do about it?Watch ABC News Live on Mondays at 3 p.m. to hear more about gun violence from experts during roundtable discussions. And check back tomorrow, when we look at the true cost of gun violence.Rather, 2020 was a turbulent time that presented COVID-19 concerns and economic downturn as well as a racial reckoning that rocked communities in multiple ways, including massive protests and civil unrest.It also was a time when an estimated 23 million guns were purchased -- a 65% increase from 2019, according to Small Arms Analytics, a consulting firm that tracks gun sales. It is unclear if the increase in gun purchases was linked to the increase in gun violence and research is split on the connection generally.Eduardo Munoz Avarez/APA woman looks at vases of white flowers that are part of an installation representing 1,050 lives lost by gun violence in New York last year, Oct. 7, 2021, in New York.The violence unfolded across the country, big and small cities alike. Overall, 57% of 129 law enforcement agencies surveyed across the nation by the Police Executive Research Forum reported an increase in gun homicides from 2019 to 2020, according to the January 2021 report.The agencies serving the biggest cities reported a 75% increase in firearm homicides in 2020 compared to 2019, and all surveyed agencies also reported a nearly 70% increase in nonfatal shootings.MORE: Gun violence in America: Defining the problemColorado mother-of-three Ana Thallas' life changed forever amid the pandemic when her daughter Isabella was fatally shot while walking her dog with her boyfriend in a Denver park on June 10, 2020, just two days after her 21st birthday. Her boyfriend was shot twice by the suspect but survived.The Denver District Attorney's office said that Michael Close, 37, allegedly got into an argument with the couple \"over a command they used to have their dog defecate,\" and he opened fire with an assault rifle.\"I never thought my daughter would be slaughtered mid-morning walking a dog in the middle of the city,\" Thallas told ABC News. \"This pandemic has created fear within people. Just having to be secluded, cooped up and isolated contributed to the mental health crisis. Fear turns into anger, and the anger turns into violence.\"Courtesy Natascha Lee StudiosIsabella Thallas was fatally shot while walking her dog with her boyfriend in a Denver park on June 10, 2020, just two days after her 21st birthday.Courtesy Ana ThallasAna Thallas poses with her daughter, Isabella, for a photo.I never thought my daughter would be slaughtered mid-morning walking a dog in the middle of the city ... This pandemic has created fear within people2020 was a 'perfect storm'Dr. Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said 2020 was the \"perfect storm\" of conditions where \"everything bad happened at the same time -- you had the COVID outbreak, huge economic disruption, people were scared.\"At the same time, after-school programs and violence disruption programs were greatly restricted, plus 2020 was an election year, during which gun purchases tend to rise for fear that the new administration will change gun policies, Webster said.\"It's particularly challenging to know with certainty which of these things independently is associated with the increased violence. Rather it was the 'cascade' of events all unfolding in a similar time frame,\" he added.For instance, as kids moved to at-home online learning due to school closures and many parents either lost jobs or had to work remotely -- all while grappling with financial stress and social isolation -- there was gun violence in some of their homes.From March to December 2020, unintentional shooting deaths by children rose 31% over the same time in 2019, resulting in 128 gun deaths, according to the Everytown #NotAnAccident Index.Unsafe storage likely played a role, experts say. A January study by the University of California, Davis violence prevention research program found \"more than 50,000 Californians said they had started storing at least one of their firearms in the least secure way -- loaded and not locked up,\" Nicole Kravitz-Wirtz, an assistant professor with VPRP who led the study said. \"Approximately half of those respondents lived in homes with children or teens.\"People changed how they stored guns based on \"fear and anxiety and pandemic-induced uncertainty about the future,\" the study found.Detroit Free Press via USA Today Network, FILEA cable lock secures a pistol at Brown Bear Sporting Goods store in Chesterfield Twp., Mich. on  Jan. 23, 2021.But storing a firearm unsecured is a massive risk, Kravitz-Wirtz said, especially for unintentional shootings and suicide. Approximately 60% of gun deaths are suicides according to CDC data.Although preliminary CDC data shows that overall suicides in the U.S. slightly decreased in 2020 compared to the year prior, gun suicides still surpassed 24,000, just as they did in 2019.In 2020, everything bad happened at the same time -- you had the COVID outbreak, huge economic disruption, people were scaredAnother way gun violence played out in homes was through domestic violence incidents.A study entitled \"Firearm purchasing and firearm violence during the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.\" analyzed data from March through July 2020 and found that excess firearm purchasing was associated with an increase in firearm injuries from domestic violence in April and May, \"particularly during the early months where social distancing was at its highest point,\" said Julia P. Schleimer, the main author of the report with UC Davis' violence prevention research program. The authors say that linking firearm violence to civil unrest and other factors during summer of 2020 had to be studied further.The pandemic led to an 8% increase in calls for domestic violence services in March, April and May, the initial three months of the pandemic, in 14 large U.S. cities, according to a study published in Journal of Public Economics.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty ImagesA volunteer prepares food at a shelter for homeless and battered women and their dependent children in Paterson, N.J., Feb. 25, 2021.MORE: One nation under fire: A week's glance at gun violence ripping across AmericaThe Domestic Violence Hotline also received the highest incoming volume in its history, with over 636,000 calls, chats and texts in 2020, including a 19% rise in callers experiencing the use or threat of firearms last year, according to the organization.The pandemic may have put many people in a vulnerable situation as research shows that access to a gun makes it five times more likely that a woman will die at the hands of a domestic abuser, according to the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence.Impact on Black and Latino communities ​An analysis of nine U.S. cities found that over 85% of the increase in gun violence from 2019 to 2020 was in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods.These groups had to deal with the converging crises in 2020: coronavirus and gun violence. They were already disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, with Black and Hispanic people nearly twice as likely to die from COVID-19, according to CDC data.At the same time, Black people are 10 times more likely to die from gun homicide than white people, according to an Everytown analysis of the CDC's Underlying Cause of Death database. In 2019, Latino people were nearly twice as likely to be killed by guns than non-Hispanic whites, according to a study from the Violence Policy Center.Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty ImagesActivists hold a memorial vigil for ten-year-old Justin Wallace outside the home where he was shot to death, June 9, 2021, in the Edgemere neighborhood of Far Rockaway, Queens, New York.In the pandemic, these groups also were disproportionately affected by job loss and financial strife compared to white households, according to a summer 2020 poll by NPR, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Further, these more than half of all Black, Latino and Native American workers hold essential and nonessential jobs that must be done in person, compared to 41% of white workers, even as many jobs went remote out of safety precautions, according to a December 2020 report by the Urban Institute.John Donohue, a Stanford University law professor who studies gun violence, said time periods of stress are associated with more shootings.\"It does seem that the dislocations of the pandemic were in neighborhoods that were more vulnerable to both the economic insecurities and just pressures of a more stressful life,\" Donahue said. \"The pandemic was a major disruption.\"Kravitz-Wirtz told ABC News that the violence was concentrated \"in neighborhoods that have experienced systemic racism and disinvestment.\"The closure of community centers and suspension of many violence prevention organizations also led to \"destabilization that can really create the conditions for violence to emerge,\" she added.As gun violence played out in homes and communities, law enforcement also faced challenges responding to crime due to COVID-19 concerns and tensions with the public.MORE: Gun violence in America: NewarkDonohue said civil unrest and police played a role in the storm.Officers couldn't be \"as effective in stopping crime,\" because they were responding to protests around the country in 2020 decrying racism and police brutality in the wake of George Floyd's death by Minneapolis police, Donohue said.Several police agencies also reported they scaled back proactive enforcement due to the pandemic, such as making fewer traffic stops and suspending gun buyback programs, the Police Executive Research Forum said in their January 2021 report.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesPolice patrol a park as local politicians, religious leaders and members of the Harlem community participate in a 'Make Our Streets Safe for Our Children' march and rally on Oct. 08, 2021, in New York.\"You had police departments overtaxed in response to COVID because their officers were getting sick. Then you had the George Floyd murder and ripple effects from protests and then often violent response by law enforcement,\" Webster said. \"There is a clear connection between trust in police and community safety, all of this takes a toll on public safety.\"Increase in gun ownershipResearchers at the UC Davis violence prevention research program issued a statewide survey in July 2020 that asked respondents specifically if they acquired a gun due to the pandemic as well as their concerns about violence in the health crisis. They found that an estimated 110,000 California adults acquired a firearm in response to fears stemming from the pandemic, including 47,000 new firearm owners, according to the January study.The survey respondents who bought firearms mainly did so for protection, with 76% saying they were concerned about lawlessness, 56% about prisoner releases and 49% that the government was going too far due to changes during the pandemic.One in 10 residents surveyed also expressed fear that someone they knew may intentionally harm someone or themselves due to pandemic losses including losing a loved one, job or housing.Experts are split on whether the stunning rise in gun purchases will fuel future firearm violence.Mario Tama/Getty Images, FILEA man walks with a stroller as people stand in line outside the Martin B. Retting, Inc. gun store on March 15, 2020, in Culver City, Calif.While there is a broad field of research that provides evidence that gun availability increases the risk for firearm violence, 2020 is unique in that other compounding factors are at play.Last year's trends have already continued into 2021, with over 31,000 gun violence deaths recorded, according to Gun Violence Archive data, and over 27 million background checks initiated so far, according to National Instant Criminal Background Check System data.We still are going to have to contend with the politicians, growing power of weaponry and its increasing availability and tensions between the public and the police -- all unhelpful for restricting crimeSchleimer, who studied firearm purchases and firearm violence in 2020, said it's possible that increased firearm access and continuing stressors could \"result in an increased risk of firearm violence moving forward.\"The US can 'shift the trajectory'Donohue, though, forecasts some of the violence could taper off with the end of the pandemic.\"As the pandemic recedes, you'll get some restoration of normality,\" he said. \"But we still are going to have to contend with the politicians, growing power of weaponry and its increasing availability and tensions between the public and the police -- all unhelpful for restricting crime.\"MORE: Gun violence claiming more lives of American teens, childrenKravitz-Wirtz said there's been \"positive momentum\" to reverse the pandemic's trend of gun violence. But she warned that root issues of inequality need to be addressed through \"thriving wage\" jobs, housing security and youth empowerment programs especially in Black and brown communities.Courtesy Ana ThallasA mural of Isabella Thallas in Denver was painted by a local artist after her murder in Denver's Ballpark neighborhood and about a month later the park was renovated.\"There's a real opportunity now,\" Kravitz-Wirtz said. \"We can really shift the trajectory that we've been experiencing in positive directions if we can follow through on the data-informed and community wisdom-informed strategies.\"On a national and state level, there have been efforts to mitigate gun violence. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced federal strike forces in five major cities to take down gun trafficking corridors over the summer, and President Joe Biden unveiled several executive actions to combat the rise in shootings. The administration has also allowed coronavirus relief funds to be used for community violence intervention.In Colorado, Thallas helped get the Isabella Joy Act passed in honor of her daughter. It requires gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement within five days of realizing the weapon is missing. The Denver Police Department said the shooter in Isabella's case had taken a rifle from a friend's home without their knowledge or permission, CBS Denver affiliate KCNC reported.Thallas is now calling for the act, which went into effect last month, to be implemented nationally.\"Unfortunately I don't see an end to this [gun] epidemic. Encouraging responsible gun ownership would be more realistic,\" Thallas said. \"It's our family that pays the life sentence with Isabella's death. Don't doubt this couldn't be you. Be proactive, not reactive.\"",

        "Text": "The future of the Minneapolis Police Department may be decided on Tuesday.A ballot measure is asking voters if the city should amend its charter to replace the police department with the Department of Public Safety, which would take a \"comprehensive public health approach.\"The new department could include police officers, but there wouldn't be a required minimum number to employ. The MPD had 588 officers as of mid-October and was authorized for up to 888, according to The Associated Press.MORE: Timeline: The impact of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis and beyondThe charter amendment would replace the police chief with a commissioner nominated by the mayor and approved by the City Council. By state law, the charter amendment would go into effect 30 days after it passes.\"​​It's a vote for us to all reimagine public safety and to move away from the type of systems that have not produced safety for all communities,\" said Rashad Robinson, a spokesperson for Color of Change PAC, which organized in support of the ballot measure.Jerry Holt/Star Tribune via Getty Images, FILEIn this June 7, 2020, file photo, Alondra Cano, Minneapolis City Council 9th Ward member, spoke to community members at \"The Path Forward\" meeting at Powderhorn Park in Minneapolis.City Council member Jeremiah Ellison told ABC News that the police department would become a division of law enforcement within the Department of Public Safety.\"Question two is about are we locked into our current system of public safety, this police only model,\" he said. \"Are we locked into this model, that's what voting no does, or do we have an ability to transform public safety into the future? That's what a yes does.\"While supporters of the charter amendment connect it to the calls for police reform that followed George Floyd's killing last year, opponents, including those who want reform, have said the measure is ill-defined and crafted without enough community input.\"We skipped over a lot of steps that would normally happen when you're bringing about a change of this magnitude, and people are being sold a proposal that has no plan attached to it,\" said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minneapolis civil rights attorney and activist. \"There's no certainty of what this new department will actually look like, how it will function and whether it will actually address the underlying public safety issues.\"MORE: Activists push to disband Minneapolis police in upcoming voteMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo similarly criticized the charter amendment at a press conference on Wednesday.\"It will not eliminate tragic incidents between police and community from ever occurring in our city,\" he said. \"It will not suddenly change the culture of the police department that has been in existence for 155 years.\"Voters appear divided. North Minneapolis resident Tallaya Byers said that she supports the public safety charter amendment because she feels current police officers aren't trained to handle certain situations, like those involving people who use drugs or have a mental illness.\"It will bring an element to where they can identify and analyze situations, to where people are not seen as such a threat,\" Byers said. \"For me, it's going to help the police officers do their job, analyze situations, have a conversation. It's that simple.\"MORE: More than a year after George Floyd's killing, Congress can't agree on police reformTeto Wilson, a North Minneapolis resident who owns a barbershop, said that he plans to vote against the ballot measure because proponents haven't elaborated on how it will affect people of color.\"I think policing needs to be radically reformed, and they're proposing this charter amendment like it's a radical change to policing, but how can you say that you haven't told us what that means,\" he said. \"What's going to be in this Department of Public Safety?\"He added: \"They have not told us what it would look like other than, you know, we're gonna have mental health workers that are going to show up on calls. I can't see how that's going to solve our problems.\"John Minchillo/APJessica Knutson, and her daughter Abigail, 3, place flowers at a memorial to George Floyd, May 31, 2020, in Minneapolis.Some council members have pushed back on claims that they haven't explained the proposal thoroughly. Council member Phillipe Cunningham tweeted in August that the city attorney advised council members to not engage on an outline of the ordinance that would explain the functions of the proposed Department of Public Safety because it could be seen as advocacy.\"A charter change is supposed to be as barebones as possible,\" he said. \"You're not going to put a bunch of details that might need to be flexible in the charter, you're going to put a skeleton language in the charter.\"Ellison added that amending the charter would not reallocate funds. According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the most recent police budget approved was $164 million, with an additional $11 million accessible if approved by the City Council.MORE: Body cam footage shows Minneapolis police allegedly 'hunting' anti-police brutality protestersWilson said he was worried neighborhood crime may increase with fewer officers. Armstrong mentioned a similar concern.\"Many in our community feel as though we have already been underserved when it comes to having to call 911 or receiving an adequate response when there is a crisis,\" she added.Robinson, the Color of Change spokesperson, said that the charter amendment gives the city more tools for approaching public safety issues.\"The community has been doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result,\" he said. \"This is putting something new on the table and hoping to build some new ways of really bringing about safety and bringing about justice.\"But Armstrong, a local organizer, pushed back on that idea.\"It's a false dichotomy between voting 'no' and keeping things the same, or voting 'yes' and agreeing to this new public safety charter amendment,\" she said. \"Really, we should have had a community engagement process. We should have had evidence-based practices and we should have had options in terms of what kind of structure, you know, the MPD should become, versus being boxed into voting 'no' or voting 'yes.'\"ABC News' Zachary Kiesch and Briana Stewart contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "This is part 1 of a three-part ABC News series looking at one chilling case of right-wing extremism in America’s heartland. Part 2 is available here and part 3 is available here.Dan Day, a God-fearing family man, describes his shotgun, two rifles and three handguns as “a bare minimum” for anyone in Kansas.The InformantHomegrown extremist groups remain one of the greatest threats to the U.S,, join George Stephanopoulos for a never-before-seen look at the takedown of a terrorist attack.Stream On HuluHe fiercely defends the Second Amendment and the right of Americans to form militias. Years ago, he developed a distaste for “everything the government is,” he said.Then he became one of the FBI’s most unexpected informants, and derailed a domestic terrorism plot that authorities determined could have eclipsed the Oklahoma City bombing.For more than a year, in the midst of 2016’s polarizing presidential campaign, Day braved a twisted world of hatred and violence, putting his life and his family on the line to infiltrate a radical militia group bent on killing Muslims in small-town Garden City, Kansas. Their attack was slated for the day after the election.“It sounds so far-fetched, but it’s not,” said Day, 53. “And if it can happen in southwest Kansas, it can happen anywhere.”In a series of exclusive interviews with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, he and his family opened up for the first time about what they endured over many months when Day befriended three murderous men and secretly recorded hundreds of hours with them.His story is featured in the new ABC News documentary “The Informant: Fear and Faith in the Heartland,” now available on Hulu. It also features exclusive interviews with the FBI agents and federal prosecutor who led the investigation.ABC NewsFormer FBI informant Dan Day drives through Garden City, Kan., in August 2021.“I don't know how [Day] did it,” said veteran national security prosecutor Tony Mattivi. “He knew … the parade of horribles that could happen with one slip, with one mistake, and he did it anyway.”ABC News obtained a cache of recordings from Day’s case, capturing the men’s violent rhetoric and raw voices in real-time. The U.S. Justice Department has refused to release those recordings, which provide a chilling play-by-play from inside a domestic terrorism plot -- something rarely seen or heard by the public.“I had to go along with them,” Day said of the hate-fueled men he followed. “The double life got real, and scary.”‘Really? That guy?’When FBI agent Amy Kuhn, based out of the FBI’s remote office in the small town of Garden City, Kansas, first suggested to her partner, Robin Smith, that they try to recruit Day as an informant in July 2015, Smith looked at her in bewilderment.“Really? That guy?” Smith, who retired last year, recalled asking Kuhn.ABC NewsAgent Amy Kuhn and her former partner, Robin Smith, look through evidence from the \"Crusaders\" case, inside the FBI's office in Garden City, Kan., October 2020.Day, a former probation officer, had come onto the FBI’s radar through a bizarre chain of events, which included Day unwittingly attending a recruitment event for a local militia.Smith said Day, raised as a self-described “country boy” in Garden City, seemed to “fit the mold” of a militia member, not a government informant.But Kuhn felt differently and persuaded Day to become an informant. Unlike many others who help the FBI, Day didn’t have any charges hanging over his head. He agreed to do it simply because he cared about his community and his country, Kuhn said.‘Almost Satanic’According to Kuhn, most militias are harmless, just “preppers” readying for “the zombie apocalypse” or whatever else they think might be coming. But when she recruited Day, the FBI was grappling with a growing faction of violent radicalism within the nation’s militia movement.For several months, Day didn’t find that level of radicalism. Then in February 2016, Day was introduced to Patrick Stein, a member of another militia, the Kansas Security Force (KSF).“And that’s when things changed,” Day said.Stein FamilyPatrick Stein is pictured with family members in an undated family photo.Stein, then 47, was a farmer in Wright, Kansas, about an hour away from Garden City.He “seemed like a nice guy,” someone who could “carry on an intelligent conversation” about farming or economics, but when the conversation turned to Muslims in the area, “He just went berserk … almost Satanic,” Day said.ISIS had been launching attacks around the world and inspiring Americans to conduct their own attacks at home. The U.S. government expressed confidence in vetting refugees who fled ISIS in Syria and came to the United States, but the government also acknowledged shortcomings.To Stein, every Muslim inside the U.S. homeland posed a clear and present danger.“They are the threat that we have in this country right now,” Stein was recorded by Day saying.Over and over again, Stein reduced innocent men, women and children to “cockroaches” that “need to be eradicated” simply for being Muslim.He dubbed himself “Orkinman,” like the exterminator.1:24Former FBI agent on hearing 'shocking' recordings of bomb plot planningRobin Smith describes the moment he realized a militia group plotting to kill Muslim refugees in Kansas was \"completely committed to creating an attack.\" Watch \"The Informant\" on Hulu.‘He’s dangerous’Garden City, with a population nearing 30,000, has in recent decades become a refuge for immigrants from around the world. Mexican and Vietnamese restaurants crowd many streets.In the early 2000s, refugees fleeing al Qaeda-linked groups and civil war in Somalia began moving to Garden City. Many of them found jobs at a Tyson meatpacking plant on the outskirts of town, which has long served as an anchor for the city’s immigrant community because it provides a reliable paycheck and a chance at the American dream.ABC NewsA sign sits on the edge of Garden City, Kan., in October 2020.Stein didn’t see it that way.“What g----mn company in their right mind would hire all these motherf---ing employees … and hand them all these knives,” he said on one of the recordings obtained by ABC News.Muslims “would cut your f---ing throat if [they] had half a chance,” Stein insisted.The FBI hadn’t heard of Stein or the KSF until Day warned Kuhn and Smith. “You need to watch this guy. He’s dangerous,” Day remembered telling them.Based on Day’s initial reports and recordings, the FBI also became concerned about two other KSF members, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright, who worked together at Wright’s mobile home dealership outside of town.Sedgwick County SheriffGavin Wright, Patrick Stein and Curtis Allen are pictured in October 2016 booking photos released by the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office.“My direction to Dan from the beginning was, ‘Don’t be the person to start anything. … Don’t be the idea planter. Just go along with what other people are saying,’” Kuhn said.The group held militia events and nightly conference calls. They traded wild conspiracy theories, raged over President Barack Obama’s willingness to bring refugees to the United States and used vile rhetoric to ridicule Somalis living in southeast Kansas.Day often put the calls on speakerphone to record them for the FBI.“We knew that we had some guys that really did not like the Muslim community,” but even after tracking them for nearly four months, the FBI “didn’t have a clear concept” that they were willing to take violent action, Smith said.Then something big happened.‘Organization mode’On June 12, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen, who was born in New York to Afghan immigrants, opened fire inside the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Swearing allegiance to ISIS, he killed 49 people and wounded scores more.Joe Raedle/Getty Images, FILELaw enforcement officials investigate at the Pulse nightclub where a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 58 others, on June 13, 2016, in Orlando, Fla.The attack spurred Stein to take action. Two days later, on a scorching hot day, Stein directed several KSF members to meet him in the middle of a field three hours outside Garden City. He said he wanted others to join him.“I went into organization mode,” Day recorded Stein saying during one conversation. “I’m done waiting.”The field meeting was the first time the FBI had Day wear a hidden recording device -- a “big step” beyond just recording phone conversations like he’d been doing for months, Kuhn acknowledged.“It wasn’t like in the movies, with a van full of FBI agents 20 feet away [ready] to come in and rescue me” if something goes wrong, Day said. “I’m 60 miles away from everything. I’m on my own.”The FBI had concluded the field was so remote that, as Smith explained it, any “assets” or unfamiliar vehicles “likely would have been compromised.” So Day “was alone,” with “no backup,” said Mattivi, who oversaw the case.ABC NewsA field in southwest Kansas where former FBI informant Dan Day brought Patrick Stein in 2016.Day had no doubt Stein or one of the others would kill him if they found out he was working for the FBI they might even bury him in the field right there, he said.“The f---ing cockroaches in this country have got to go. Period,” Stein told the other KSF members, as Day recorded. “They’re bringing them in by the f---ing planeload every goddamn day. That g----mn [racial slur] in the White House is making sure of it.”The meeting ended for Day when, about 20 minutes into Stein’s big pitch, Day fainted from heat exhaustion.“You can’t make this stuff up,” Kuhn chuckled. “Craziness happens.”After regaining consciousness, Dan immediately checked for the FBI’s recording device, concerned someone might have found it, he said.It was still there, but it was “a very close call,” Day said. He was treated at a local hospital and released within hours.‘Killing people’Stein then convened two more recruitment meetings at a militia member’s home. Allen was apparently already onboard with the plan.ABC NewsA home outside Garden City, Kan., where five years earlier Patrick Stein held a recruitment meeting with other members of the Kansas Security Force militia,  August 2021.“It’s probably killing people and going to prison for life,” Day recorded Allen telling the KSF members gathered there in early July 2016.In his interview with ABC News, Smith choked up thinking about when he first heard those recorded words.“That to me showed a significant level of commitment that was nothing less than shocking,” Smith said, his voice cracking.Federal Public Defender's OfficeCurtis Allen with his daughter in an undated photo.At the time, some of the other KSF members pushed back on what Stein and Allen were proposing.“I’m not just gonna go up and start … gunning down Muslims,” one woman was heard saying on Day's recording from that day.As a militia, KSF was meant to be “on the defensive,” she insisted.“You want them to strike first?” Day asked.“I’m not doing anything to risk my kids going in foster care,” the woman responded. “I am 100 percent with a defensive position.”1:02Listen to FBI informant's secret recordings of 3 men plotting domestic terror bombingDan Day befriended three men who planned a terrorist plot to kill Muslim refugees in a small Kansas town, and he secretly recorded hours of conversations with them. Watch \"The Informant\" on Hulu.Ultimately, Allen, Wright and Day were the only ones who said they were willing to take up arms with Stein.“We need to … start planning it,” Allen declared after the last recruitment meeting. “[But] I don’t know where we can meet to where we can openly talk.”“Well,” Wright suggested, “I got my office,” referring to a trailer on the lot of his business, G&G Home Center. “We could meet in there any time.”No one Stein tried to recruit called authorities.‘Good men’ doing ‘bad things’Stein gave his new foursome a name: “The Crusaders” -- like the medieval Crusades, when “Muslims almost wiped out the Christians,” but this would be “Crusades 2.0,” Stein said.Justice DepartmentThe trailer at G&G Mobile Home Center where Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright and Dan Day often met in 2016 is pictured in a Justice Department image dated October 2016.The “Crusaders” were convinced that Wright’s G&G business, more than an hour away from Garden City, was beyond the reach of the FBI.In some ways, they were right. It was another location too remote for the FBI to deploy surveillance teams, so Day’s survival was once again in his own hands when the group started meeting there in August 2016.Each meeting lasted several hours, sometimes as long as a full shift of work.“These guys would talk about everything under the sun,” recalled Mattivi, who retired last year. “They’d talk about politics. They’d talk about football. … But they also talked about the plot.”“It’s gonna take a lot of good men to do a lot of bad things to turn s--- around,” Stein said at one of those early meetings. “[But] what are those bad things that we need to do?”“Once we get a target, then critique it, just go from there,” Day told the group.In meeting after meeting, Day’s recordings showed, the men struggled to pick a target, meandering through an array of possibilities: An apartment complex. A mosque. A Somali store. A bus transporting refugees. Maybe even Christian churches that are helping refugees.They similarly waffled over how to conduct their attack, floating all sorts of ideas: Pumping poisonous gas into a building. Breaking in doors and opening fire. Setting an apartment complex ablaze. Kidnapping and raping women.“The more we talk, the more I’m just about ready to f---ing do anything, honestly,” Stein said during one meeting at G&G.ABCThe \"African Shop\" in Garden City, Kansas, October 2020.The FBI then placed a tracking device on Stein’s pickup truck, just in case.A manifesto like the Unabomber’sWhile the “Crusaders” continued to brainstorm big ideas for an attack, Allen suggested they release a treatise with whatever they decide to do.“I’m talking about putting out that -- what do we call that thing?” Allen asked.A “manifest!” one of them confidently declared.No, it’s a “manifesto,” another corrected.“Like Brzezinski put out,” Allen blurted, confusing even himself. “It’s not Brzezinski. What’s the other’s name?”“The Unabomber?” Day asked, referring to Ted Kaczynski, whose decades-long bombing campaign ended in 1995 with a rambling essay in the Washington Post.“Kaczynski!” Allen affirmed. “We’re going to try to trigger the other like-minded people across the nation to stand up and start doing the same thing we’re doing.”The exchange would have been comical if they weren’t discussing a deadly plot.John Youngbear/AP, FILETed Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, is flanked by federal agents as he is led to a car from the federal courthouse in Helena, Mont., April 4, 1996.By mid-August 2016, with only a few months to go before the presidential election, the group was on the verge of picking a target for their attack. They were also experimenting with bomb-making materials, and about to meet one of Day’s old “connections” – an undercover FBI agent posing as a dangerous criminal who could help them.What happened next is laid out in the second part of this exclusive series from ABC News: “‘We were infiltrated, mom’: Secret recordings track demise of domestic terror attack.”How Stein, Wright and Allen become so filled with hate, before ever encountering Day, is detailed in the third and final installment of this series: “Becoming a domestic terrorist.”ABC News' Cho Park, Eamon McNiff, Jennifer Joseph and Chris Donovan contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "This is part 2 of a three-part ABC News series looking at one chilling case of right-wing extremism in America’s heartland. Part 1 is available here and part 3 is available here.Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright, three Kansas militia men determined to kill Muslim refugees in the small town of Garden City, Kansas, spent months trying to choose a target.The InformantHomegrown extremist groups remain one of the greatest threats to the U.S,, join George Stephanopoulos for a never-before-seen look at the takedown of a terrorist attack.Stream On HuluThey met regularly at Wright’s business, G&G Mobile Home Center, rattling off possible victims, while a fourth man they recruited, Dan Day, critiqued their ideas and offered his own views.What they didn’t know at the time was that Day was working for the FBI and secretly recording the meetings.In a series of exclusive interviews with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Day and his family described what they endured for months, as Day tried to stop an attack slated for the day after the 2016 presidential election. Day's story is featured in the new ABC News documentary “The Informant: Fear and Faith in the Heartland,” now available on Hulu.ABC News obtained a cache of the recordings Day made, offering a rare, real-time look at what it takes to stop a terrorist plot fueled by hatred and hysteria.“Ask yourself, would you be willing to do what he did?” Robin Smith, one of the FBI agents who ran the case, said of Day. “Would you be willing to risk what he risked?”ABC Former FBI informant Dan Day uses a laptop, July 2021.‘Anything that will kill and maim’When the group’s hunt for a target began, they used GoogleEarth to find potential victims.“Drop pins every location where we know them bastards are at. … Then print it off, you got a map,” Stein said at a recorded meeting in early August 2016.One of the locations they marked was a single-story apartment complex at 312 West Mary Street, where more than 100 people, almost all of them from Somalia, lived and even more prayed each day inside an apartment converted into a mosque there. Stein and Day had previously scoped it out.When it’s not too windy or too cold outside, the complex blooms with “people playing and barbecuing,” said Ifrah Ahmed, a Somali refugee and leader in Garden City's Muslim community. “Typical American life.”One resident there was a woman in her late 50s, who was blinded as a teenager when al Qaeda-linked terrorists detonated a bomb in Somalia. Another resident was a young mother who had just given birth to a boy named Samir.“Cockroaches,” Stein called them, using his favorite term for anyone who’s Muslim.ABCA boy plays near the apartment complex at 312 West Mary Street in Garden City, Kansas, summer 2021.The FBI wanted Day to nudge the group to pick the apartments and mosque at 312 West Mary Street as their target. The complex was close to the FBI office, making it “easier” for the FBI to scramble there if necessary, according to agent Amy Kuhn, Smith’s partner at the time. So Day promoted it.“I’d take out that mosque,” Day told the men in mid-August 2016, as his hidden device recorded. “It’s just a brick and frame building, kind of like a house.”Eventually, the men settled on that West Mary Street apartment complex as their target.They also finally concluded that a bombing would be best.“We’re gonna … be putting [in] nails, ball bearings, goddamn sheet rock, knife blades,” Stein said in early September 2016.“Anything that will kill and maim,” Wright added.ABCFormer FBI agent Robin Smith points out the mosque in Garden City, Kansas, that was targeted by Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright, October 2020.A crisis of conscienceDay said he constantly “struggled” with his role as an FBI informant.He regularly worried that someone may have followed him home at night or figured him out some other way. Day said that early on, Allen had pointed a gun at him and warned, “Anybody finds out about [us], I’m gonna put a bullet in your head.”Day placed firearms around his house and adopted a pit bull as a security dog. He spoke with his family about what could happen to him, or them.He was also in harm’s way at G&G. Because the business was in such a remote area, an hour outside Garden City, the FBI couldn’t send surveillance teams as backup without them being noticed.“There was no one there to swoop in if something goes wrong,” noted former federal prosecutor Tony Mattivi, who oversaw the case.ABC NewsFormer FBI informant Dan Day is seen in Garden City, Kan., in July 2021.But it wasn’t just the danger that daunted Day. It was also “hard” for him to spew so much hate, he said. By the time the group started meeting at G&G, Day had already spent nearly five months with them.“I had to be like them, talk like them,” Day said. “I'm not proud of it.”On one recording, when Stein touted his “cockroach theory” that to eradicate Muslims “you can’t just kill one, you gotta kill every one of them.”Day assured Stein, “It’s going to be famous.”Day’s wife of 28 years, Cherlynn Day, said she remembers asking her husband one night: “Do you really believe them?”“It was going on for so long and … we were afraid that’s what [he] was becoming,” she said.ABCFormer FBI informant Dan Day and his wife, Cherlynn.The FBI’s ‘Oh s---’ momentDuring a meeting inside the trailer at G&G, Wright warned the group they should try to make their own bombs, because buying explosives meant “you’re gonna get set up.”For weeks, Wright and Allen tried to manufacture the explosive substance needed to set off a bigger bomb. Wright printed out nearly 1,000 pages of manuals he found online, and Allen watched instructional YouTube videos.“They ordered stuff. They had all the materials,” Day said. “They were experimenting.”0:34FBI's 'oh ----' moment when informant's recordings revealed bomb plot advancingFormer U.S. prosecutor Tony Mattivi describes when FBI informant Dan Day's recordings showed three men plotting to kill Muslims in Kansas had made homemade explosives. Watch \"The Informant\" on Hulu.Then, in mid-September 2016, Wright and Allen showed up to a meeting downright giddy. They had successfully made their own explosive, and tested it.“I could feel the percussion of it,” Wright said with a laugh. “That was f---ing awesome.”For the FBI and federal authorities, “That was our, ‘Oh s---,’ moment,” Mattivi said. “We had these guys saying on tape that they had manufactured an explosive. … That was when I started losing sleep.”ABCTony Mattivi, the former assistant U.S. attorney in Kansas who led the \"Crusaders\" prosecution, reviews records from the case on a laptop.Sounds ‘like a CIA setup’The group’s plot was developing faster than the FBI expected, and Day “was petrified of continuing to work as an informant,” Mattivi said. “But he felt like there was no way he could stop.”The FBI decided it was time to introduce an undercover agent into the operation -- someone who could “get them away from making their own explosives” and help the FBI control the plot, Kuhn said.Under the FBI’s direction, Day told the group at G&G one day that he had ties to gun-running criminals in Oklahoma with access to “anything,” even bombs. Day had vaguely mentioned such connections to Stein months earlier, so it wouldn’t have seemed out of the blue to Stein.“[These] guys, they’re the real deal,” Day is heard insisting in one of his recordings.Wright liked the idea of acquiring a bomb from someone Day knew and trusted: “That beats making it unless we have to,” Wright said.Allen was skeptical.“It just sounds weird,” he said on one recording. “It’s starting to sound like a CIA setup.”Federal Public Defender's OfficeCurtis Allen with his daughter in an undated photo.Stein, though, was eager to move forward with the plot, so he volunteered to rendezvous with Day’s “connections.”The ‘bromance’In late September 2016, Day brought Stein to the middle of another Kansas field to meet “Brian,” an undercover agent who Mattivi said looked like a “burly, bearded man’s man.”“Well,” Brian said to Stein, “I wanted to meet you [because] … I ain’t gonna give it to no jihadis to go blow up people I care about.”“I’m, uh, glad to hear that actually,” Stein responded.  “Because that’s exactly what this is going for. … To take [Muslims] out.”“I’m cool with that, man,” Brian said.The meeting was relatively uneventful, but wildly successful. Stein and Brian hit it off even more than the FBI expected.“They established a bromance,” Kuhn recalled with a smile.ABCSurveillance video captures Patrick Stein driving through Garden City, Kansas, with undercover FBI agent \"Brian,\" October 2016.They began texting each other almost daily about the “cockroaches,” the coming “war,” and “love of country.” They exchanged “LOLs” and “attaboys.”Stein even revealed to Brian that he’d decided on a date for their attack: Nov. 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election in six weeks.“[I]f we were to do this now this close to the election I am scared that it would give a lot of ammunition to the Hillary [Clinton] supporters,” Stein wrote in a text message.“Bro, that is a great line of thinking,” Brian responded.Stein also mentioned to Brian that he had “close to 300 pounds” of extra fertilizer on his farm.“We could use that,” Brian said, suggesting they build “vehicle-borne” bombs with it.Stein grew gleeful at the idea of such a big bombing: “I’d give anything to have a camera set up that would WiFi that s--- to me so I could watch it live,” he said with a chuckle.0:40FBI undercover video shows Kansas militia man discussing domestic terror plotPatrick Stein, one of three men convicted of planning a bombing to kill Muslim refugees, discusses their plot with an undercover FBI agent. Watch \"The Informant\" on Hulu. They agreed to meet up again in the coming days, so Stein could deliver the fertilizer to Brian.Another ‘Oh s---’ momentBut then Allen’s girlfriend called local police.She accused him of domestic violence, and told police, “Oh, by the way, he's a member of a militia, and he's planning to do something,” Kuhn recalled.Unaware that the FBI had been tracking the group for months, local police scrambled to G&G and arrested Allen on domestic abuse charges. Smith briefed local officials on the federal probe.Justice DepartmentThe trailer at G&G Mobile Home Center where Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright and Dan Day often met in 2016 is pictured in a Justice Department image dated October 2016.“That's another sort of ‘Oh s---’ moment for [the FBI],” Mattivi said, explaining that Allen’s arrest could have pushed Stein and Wright to “hurry up and commit a different act of violence,” or could have at least stymied the FBI investigation.After all, according to Mattivi, Wright warned Stein to scrap his next meet-up with Brian.“I didn't think he'd go through with it,” Mattivi said of Stein.But then “much to my surprise, and the surprise of a few others, Patrick [Stein] actually shows up,” Mattivi recalled. “That’s where the bromance kicks in, because Patrick says, ‘Oh, there’s no way Brian’s a cop.’”The takedownThree weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Brian and Stein met inside a local McDonald’s restaurant. In the bed of Stein’s pickup truck were six 50-pound bags of fertilizer, for car bombs.“It’ll be two vans,” Brian told Stein. “It’s gonna make a big mess. … I mean, I’ll be honest with you, there are a bunch of kids there.”“I’m sure there are,” Stein responded.ABCPatrick Stein met with undercover FBI agent \"Brian\" inside this McDonald's restaurant in Dodge City, Kansas. He was arrested in the restaurant's parking lot in October 2016.Then Stein emphasized one thing: “I’m putting my faith in Dan on this deal. Literally, I mean my whole life rides on it.”When they stood up from the table and walked outside to the parking lot, a SWAT team surrounded them with guns drawn, yelling at them to get on the ground.Moments later, an FBI team arrested Wright at his home in Oklahoma, just over the Kansas border. Allen was already in police custody for alleged domestic abuse.When the FBI searched their homes, vehicles and offices, they found buckets of bomb making materials, a finished detonator and drafts of a manifesto.“Don’t be fooled by the words ‘conspiracy theory’ or ‘domestic terrorist,’” one of the drafts said. “All this is a word game, ‘brainwashing’ by our government.’”“I think most people would read that manifesto and think, ‘Whoever wrote this is nuts,’” Mattivi said.Sedgwick County SheriffGavin Wright, Patrick Stein and Curtis Allen are pictured in October 2016 booking photos released by the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office.After Stein was transported to a county jail, he called his mother with an urgent message for the Kansas Security Force.“’Dan Day, D-A-Y, is a g----mn fed.’ … get the message out,” Stein told his mother during a recorded call. “We were f---ing infiltrated, mom.”What could have beenThe first time FBI agents Kuhn and Smith met Stein was in an interrogation room the day of the arrests.“I’m a patriot, bro. I love my country,” Stein told them. “You don’t give a f--- about your country.”“The amazing thing about the United States of America, and the Constitution that we live under, is you’re entitled to that opinion, and … I won’t kill you because you believe differently than me,” Smith responded.ABC Garden City, Kansas, resident Halima Farah hugs a neighbor’s young son in the parking lot of 312 West Mary Street.The bombing in Garden City “would have completely shaken the foundation of America,” Smith, who retired last year, told ABC News.Halima Farah was one of the Somali refugees living at the apartment complex at the time.“If the bombing actually happened, maybe I wouldn’t be here,” she told ABC News. “And he wouldn’t be here,” she said, hugging a neighbor’s young son.Based on an FBI analysis, Mattivi said what Stein planned “would have leveled that apartment building and almost certainly killed every single man, woman and child in it,” leaving behind a “level of carnage” potentially greater than the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, when 168 died and hundreds more were injured.ABCTony Mattivi, a federal prosecutor for more than two decades, was the Justice Department's national security coordinator in Kansas until he retired last year. He spoke with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in June 2021.Convicted and sentencedAfter a five-week trial in 2018, featuring a squad of Justice Department prosecutors and five days of testimony from their star witness, Dan Day, a federal jury convicted Stein, Wright and Allen of terrorism- and civil rights-related charges.The jury – and more recently a federal appeals court – rejected claims by their attorneys that Day and the FBI “pushed” the men “down the path that would lead to action, arrest, and chargeable offenses,” as Stein’s attorney put it.The attorneys also claimed that nearly $33,000 the government paid Day, who was out of work at the time, incentivized Day to cultivate the plot. But Day strongly disputed that, telling ABC News, “I could’ve made more money working at McDonald’s.”Mattivi said that -- considering the amount of time Dan spent as a government informant and trial witness -- \"you work it out to an hourly basis [and] I'm not sure it was even minimum wage.\"Allen and Wright were each sentenced to at least 25 years in prison. Stein was sentenced to 30 years behind bars.In handwritten letters from federal prison in Beaumont, Texas, Stein told ABC News the public is “only hearing the government’s version of things,” which “make me look as horrible as possible.”Obtained by ABC NewsThe FBI conducted a test of a 300-pound fertilizer bomb to illustrate the potential impact of an attack like the one discussed by Patrick Stein.“I’m not going to say there isn’t some truth in what you’re reading about me and the case – kinda hard to deny actual recordings,” he wrote. “What I will say is that there is a WHOLE LOT MORE to the story than has ever come out.”He didn’t elaborate.‘The heart of a hero’As terrifying as his ordeal was, Day said what he went through shows “you don’t have to be friends” with people who are different, “but you don’t have to hate them” either.He said he has only one regret: “That [his family] had to go through the things that they did.”Over a game of Monopoly one night, Day’s college-age daughter told her “old man” not to regret anything, because what he did saved lives.“No one else had to suffer, and we're coming out on top,” Alyssa Day said, even as she acknowledged the experience has affected her dad in “negative ways too.”ABC Former FBI informant Dan Day, left, his wife and his two children play a game of Monopoly, August 2021.Day believes he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, and he said nightmares of mayhem and mangled babies still haunt him at times.Ahmed, the leader in Garden City's Somali community, described Day as \"one of the things that make America great.\"\"He put his family, himself, in jeopardy for us,\" she said. \"He saw that humanity comes first, and he saw that we were beyond what they described us to be. We were not just mere cockroaches.\"“Dan Day is just an average guy who, when confronted with a situation that he didn't want and he didn't ask for, dug down deep and found the heart of a hero,” said Mattivi, who retired last year and, as a Republican, is now running to become the next attorney general of Kansas.Day rejected the notion that he’s any kind of hero.“It wasn’t just me. It was a lot of the FBI, and God,” he said.To understand how Stein, Wright and Allen were driven to such extremes, read the first part of this exclusive series from ABC News: “Becoming a domestic terrorist: How 3 self-styled 'patriots' were led to lethal plot.”ABC News' Cho Park, Eamon McNiff, Jennifer Joseph and Chris Donovan contributed to this report.",

Many choose a gang lifestyle in order to survive, and depend on illicit means of income that often use force to control turf. It is hard to escape from that setting and that is a great tragedy of our country. Guns are a part of that culture sadly. That is why you keep reading these stories over and over.

On Sept. 30, RSVP decided to elevate the information to several university departments, including public safety.A separate incident of an alleged sexual assault by a member of the fraternity was also reported to the school's Department of Public Safety on Oct. 16.Al Seib/ShutterstockUSC sophomore students Claire Smerdon and Charlie Littleworth re-tape notes attached to the Sigma Nu fraternity house near the USC campus, Oct. 22, 2021, in Los Angeles.The school's Clery Office, which tracks and discloses campus crime, received information on both sets of events on Oct. 20, at which point the Sigma Nu fraternity was suspended and students notified.\"We now know that there was a troubling delay in acting on this information, and specifically in evaluating it for notification to the community,\" Folt wrote in her letter.\"We are still investigating what occurred next, but there was clearly uncertainty regarding how to assess and process the information, and it was not immediately escalated to the Clery Office or others,\" she added.MORE: Breaking down University of Southern California's $1.1 billion in sex abuse settlementsSince first alerting the school community to the alleged incidents at Sigma Nu, USC has received additional reports of sexual assault and possible drugging at other fraternity houses this fall and in previous years, Folt said.All incidents disclosed to the school since Sept. 25 have been reported to the Los Angeles Police Department, which said last week it was investigating possible drug-facilitated sexual assaults.Al Seib/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesUSC officials have placed the Sigma Nu fraternity chapter on interim suspension following allegations that women were drugged and sexually assaulted at the fraternity house, Oct. 22, 2021, in Los Angeles.Activities at all USC fraternities have been suspended indefinitely, and USC will permanently ban or delist fraternities \"if warranted,\" Folt said.In the wake of multiple campus alerts about alleged assaults at Sigma Nu, USC students have held protests demanding action from the university. Angry notes now also plaster the Sigma Nu fraternity house with messages like \"do better\" and \"enough is enough.\"Folt became president of USC in 2019, after the previous president stepped down amid reports the school ignored allegations of widespread sexual misconduct by former campus gynecologist George Tyndall.\"As president, I came to USC with the promise to confront what is wrong and lead the effort to fix what is broken,\" she wrote in her letter. \"As we learn more, there will be some things we can do quickly and others that will take more time.

        "Text": "While some areas of the country are cautiously celebrating falling COVID-19 cases, hoping the declines might signal the return to a long-awaited sense of normalcy, some states continue to struggle as Americans prepare for winter.Health officials in Colorado are growing increasingly concerned as the rate of COVID-19 infections grows to levels not seen in more than 10 months.There is \"a clear increase in cases statewide,\" state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said in a COVID-19 briefing on Thursday.In the last month alone, the state's daily case average has nearly doubled -- increasing by 91.5% since late September, according to federal data, and state data shows that Colorado's average positivity rate has risen from just under 7% last week, to nearly 8.5% this week.\"Colorado moving in the wrong direction is a clear signal that we are not yet out of this pandemic, especially in under-vaccinated states. Colorado has yet to reach 70% with a first dose and if you layer in colder temperatures and relaxed masking, history is likely to repeat itself,\" said John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, referring to the total population of the state.Denver Post via Getty ImagesScott Helms sits outside his hotel lobby where he has a room on Sept. 2, 2021, in Denver. The hotel is being used by the Colorado Coalition for the homeless who are at high risk for contracting COVID-19.While southern states in particular are seeing significant declines in their rates of infection, several states with colder weather, like Colorado, are beginning to experience an uptick in cases, as people begin to increasingly head indoors.\"Coronaviruses tend to thrive in winter months and colder weather,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said in a White House COVID-19 briefing last week. \"Right now is not the time, as cases are coming down, to become complacent because we do know colder weather is ahead of us.\"Five states -- Alaska, Colorado, Maine, New Hampshire and New Mexico -- have all seen a percent increase in hospital admissions of about 15% or more in the last two weeks.\"We are continuing to move very much in the wrong direction,\" Scott Bookman, Colorado's COVID-19 chief, said at a briefing on Wednesday.MORE: FDA authorizes COVID-19 vaccine for kids 5-11According to state officials, the highest coronavirus case rate is among the 5- to 17-year-old age group.Coronavirus-related hospitalizations have also been increasing in the state, a trend that is particularly worrying health officials.Approximately 90% of the state's surgical and intensive care unit beds are currently in use, according to state officials. There are currently nearly 1,300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 -- the highest number of patients receiving care since December, and on average, federal data shows that nearly 200 residents are being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 each day.\"With the increase in percent of positivity and the concern of increase in cases in the coming weeks, we are all very concerned at this point about what we are seeing in our hospitals,\" said Bookman.David Zalubowski/APColorado Gov. Jared Polis speaks during a news conference about Colorado offering coronavirus vaccinations to children, Oct. 28, 2021, in Denver. Colorado is also seeing an increase in overall coronavirus cases, which is putting stress on the state's hospital systems.And as more patients stream into emergency rooms in need of care, the average number of available beds is rapidly declining.Thirty percent of hospitals anticipate an ICU bed shortage in the next week. State health officials have told ABC News that hospitals in El Paso County have had days when they've had to turn away transfer requests.The majority of those COVID-19 positive patients -- 77% -- are unvaccinated individuals.To date, 61% of the total population in Colorado has been fully vaccinated, leaving a significant number of residents still unvaccinated. People who have not been fully vaccinated are 6.1 times more likely to test positive with the virus and 11.3 times more likely to die from it, compared with people who are vaccinated, according to the CDC.MORE: COVID-19 live updates: Being vaccinated offers better protection than being infected: StudyThe notable divide between vaccinated and unvaccinated is evident in counties across the state.In Crowley County, home to just over 6,000 residents, less than 49% of the eligible population has been vaccinated with at least one shot, according to state data. High transmission across the county remains rampant. In El Paso County, which currently has one of the state's highest number of hospital admissions rate, approximately 65% of the county's population over 12 have been fully vaccinated.In total, 15 Colorado counties are significantly lagging, partially vaccinating 50% or less of their eligible population.Aaron Ontiveroz/Denver Post via Getty ImagesKelly Cummings works at a COVID testing site in the parking lot of George Washington High School in Denver, Sept. 1, 2021.Comparatively, 11 counties have vaccinated at least 80% of their total population with at least one shot. San Miguel County, with a population of over 8,100, has 74% of its population fully vaccinated, and its infection rate has remained steadily low, despite increasing figures across the rest of the state.If the situation in Colorado does not improve in the coming days, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Thursday he is prepared to take certain steps to address the uptick, including bringing in federal medical surge teams to help local hospitals in need of extra support, halting elective surgeries, expanding the use of monoclonal antibody treatment and possibly reactivating crisis standards of care, which determine how to most efficiently use medical resources, such as ventilators or ICU beds.\"A new surge once again places a challenging burden on our already tired health care professionals while also deferring important hospital procedures. This should really send a message to those still on the fence to do their part,\" said Brownstein. \"Remaining unvaccinated populations still represent opportunities for this virus to spread. This surge in Colorado should serve as an important warning to other states as we head into the winter months.\"ABC News' Jeff Cook contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "Four New York City firefighters have been suspended after driving their truck to a state senator's office while on duty, asking for the politician's home address and telling him the city would have \"blood on its hands\" over the city's vaccine mandate.The group, from Ladder 113 in Brooklyn, went to the office of state Sen. Zellnor Myrie in the company's fire district in uniform and asked to speak to him, although as a state official he had no involvement in the city mandate from Mayor Bill de Blasio.All city personnel, including firefighters, must have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by the time they show up to work on Monday. Those who do not get vaccinated will be placed on unpaid leave.The senator was not there at the time, but the firefighters spoke to a staff member.\"They said they wanted to let people in the community know that the trucks weren't going to be running and that they were going to shut down firehouses,\" a person familiar with the conversation told ABC News.MORE: Where NYC stands as COVID-19 vaccine deadline looms for city employeesIt was, the person said, a \"cordial conversation\" though at one point the firefighters said the \"city would have blood on its hands.\"\"I think it is highly inappropriate,\" Myrie, a Democrat, said in an interview with New York ABC station WABC. \"It is incredibly disturbing that those entrusted with keeping us safe would be on duty, protesting a vaccine mandate that had nothing to do with a state elected official. ... My staff is rattled, they're shaken up by it. And frankly, I am upset that we're even having this conversation.\"The firefighters told the senator's staff member they wanted the choice whether to get vaccinated and expressed a view that it would be safer for them to get tested every week.Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesFirefighters watch as their fire engine enters the FDNY Engine 281/Ladder 147 station on Oct. 29, 2021, in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn borough in New York City.Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro called the actions \"highly inappropriate.\"\"This is a highly inappropriate act by on duty members of this Department who should only be concerned with responding to emergencies and helping New Yorkers and not harassing an elected official and his staff,\" Nigro said in a statement to ABC News. \"The members in question have been immediately relieved of duty and will face disciplinary action.\"Myrie said he was satisfied with the firefighters being suspended, but that was only a first step.\"Instead of spending their time threatening elected officials and the communities that they represent, they should be focused on preventing and responding to emergencies,\" Myrie said.MORE: New York City firefighters protest vaccine mandate outside mayor's residence as deadline nearsFirefighters are one of the lowest groups of vaccinated city workers in New York, though that number crept up during the final day before the deadline, with 77% of FDNY members vaccinated, including 72% of firefighters and 84% of EMS workers, as of Friday night.About 84% of the New York Police Department is vaccinated, with 1,000 people getting their first doses on Thursday, according to Commissioner Dermot Shea.Dozens of firefighters protested the vaccine mandate outside Gracie Mansion, where de Blasio lives, on Thursday. Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York President Andrew Ansbro has warned of a \"catastrophic manpower shortage\" if the thousands of unvaccinated workers are placed on leave. De Blasio has repeatedly said contingency plans are in place and the city is not concerned about staffing problems.Ansbro said Friday of the firefighters who went to Myrie's office that they are not allowed to advocate for themselves while on duty.ABC News' Meredith Deliso contributed to this report.",

It just seems odd to me that a move that would be absolutely verboten and political suicide in the UK, and probably everywhere else in Europe, is so readily accepted by so many Americans.\n\nThe BMJ - 13 September 2021\n<b>Covid-19: US imposes mandatory vaccination on two thirds of workforce</b>\nll US companies employing more than 100 people must require their staff to be fully vaccinated or have weekly covid tests, said President Joe Biden in a televised speech that was marked by a new, harsher tone towards unvaccinated people.\n“My message to unvaccinated Americans is this,” said Biden. “What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We’ve made vaccinations free, safe, and convenient. We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us. So please, do the right thing.”\nWith just 53.7% of Americans fully vaccinated, the number of new infections has climbed steadily to above 150 000 cases a day and deaths to about 1500 a day, mostly among unvaccinated people.\nThe vaccine requirement for large employers will cover about 80 million workers. Biden’s executive order also requires the vaccination of all workers in healthcare settings that bill Medicaid or Medicare. That measure covers roughly 50 000 providers and 17 million healthcare workers.\n“<u>Today, in total, the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americans, two thirds of all workers</u>,” said Biden.\nThe government will also strengthen the mandate on its own employees. Until now, these have had the options of vaccination or weekly testing. The weekly testing option will now be removed, a measure the Biden administration is urging state governments to follow.\n<u>Biden will also order the Transportation Security Administration to increase fines on travellers who do not wear masks in airports or on buses and trains</u>. The minimum penalty for a first offence will double, to $500 (£360; €425).\nA bill introduced in Congress on 10 September by the Virginia Democratic representative Don Beyer would also require proof of vaccination or a negative test from all domestic travellers at US airports.",

            "True, but it doesn't matter if it's Delta or any other variant.  \n\n\n\nThe immunity for COVID-19, regardless of strain, is limited to about 120 days at most, and about 30 days at the least (depending on the severity of infection and one's immune system health).  So regardless of the strain, you have 30-120 days before you need to worry about reinfection if you're not immunized.\n\nIf you ARE immunized, and get COVID-19, there's evidence that the immunity you'll receive from that will last MUCH longer than being vaccinated alone.  The reverse is less studies, but it's believed that if you get immunized AFTER a COVID-19 infection, the immunity also lasts considerably longer than from a vaccine alone.\n\n\nSo not quite as simplistic as your question implies, but COVID-19 does nothing for your immunity unless you've been vaccinated, or get a vaccine after a COVID-19 infection.  COVID-19 alone won't provide any long-lasting immunity, meaning reinfection is likely within 4 months, assuming the same exposure as before.  The only caveat to that is you're twice as likely to get the Delta variant than the Beta variant (which preceded it in the U.S.) and four times more likely to be reinfected, if exposed to Delta, than from the original variant that went around in early 2020.\n\n\nHope that helps!",

Because the  Postal Service is an independent federal agency that operates under a private  sector collective bargaining model, modifications to working conditions are  mandatory subjects of bargaining. In addition, our workplaces are subject to \nregulations from the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA).

On Thursday, Sept. 9, President Biden also announced more vaccine mandates for companies.\n\nThe official White House transcript says the Department of Labor “will require all employers with 100 or more employees” to have their workers “fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week.”\n\nThe Post Office website shows, in 2020, it had nearly 495,941 employees.

That does not correlate at all.\n\nThe 10 states with the highest rates of Covid-19 infections in the past seven days are located in the South, including in Florida and Texas, where DeSantis and Abbott are preventing schools from mandating masks amid rising Covid-19 cases among children — though some schools and districts are defying the governors and requiring masks.\"",

        "Text": "Construction of an oil pipeline deep in America's heartland has become one of the most contentious environmental battles in the country.The thousand-mile long Line 3 pipeline transports Canadian tar sands oil -- a high-emissions fossil fuel often described as the world's dirtiest oil -- through indigenous lands and waters, including the vulnerable headwaters of the Mississippi River.The project has been the target of multiple court battles and a years-long massive civil disobedience campaign led by indigenous women in Minnesota, resulting in nearly 900 arrests, including dozens around the U.S. Capitol earlier this month.\"Seeing the expansion of Line 3 tar sands into sensitive wetlands while there is a massive drought is really jarring and it should be for any person who is worried about the climate,\" Tara Houska, a tribal attorney who has fought the project for years and co-founded a Line 3 opposition group, told ABC News.ABC NewsA member of a pipeline opposition camp is arrested in front of a pipeline facility during a blockade of a pipeline facility.Enbridge, the Canadian corporation responsible for the pipeline, describes Line 3 as a safety-driven replacement of an aging line first put in during the 1960s.\"We made the decision that it would be better for us, better for society, better for the communities that the pipeline runs through to actually look at replacing that pipeline,\" Enbridge Chief Communications Officer Mike Fernandez told ABC News.However, many critics refer to the project as an expansion. More than one third of the new Line 3 follows an entirely new route and the new, wider pipe will roughly double the operating capacity of the old version, according to state documents.Enbridge argues they are restoring the line's historic capacity which has not been operational for more than a decade. The move comes after some leading scientists pushed for a moratorium on tar sands growth all together.\"Climate scientists say, 'Leave the tar sands in the ground.' Full stop,\" said Laura Triplett, an environmental scientist with Gustavus Adolphus College who testified against Line 3 during the permitting process.Oil began flowing through the controversial pipeline on Oct. 1, marking a long-sought victory for its corporate owner and a devastating defeat for its opponents, who had pleaded with the Biden administration to halt the project.ABC NewsTara Houska, a tribal attorney of Couchiching First Nation, is seen during a \"direct action\" to halt construction of the Line 3 pipeline.\"I am appalled by the lack of action on something like this,\" Houska said. \"You can't be the climate president when you're allowing through one of the largest tar sands infrastructure projects in North America. That's his climate legacy,\" she said.The White House declined to provide a representative to be interviewed for this report, and did not respond to a request for comment.Biden and the tar sandsCanadian tar sands oil requires more emissions to extract and transport than conventional oil. It also results in more carbon emissions when burned, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.On the campaign trail, President Joe Biden described the Keystone XL pipeline as \"tar sands that we don't need -- that in fact is very, very high pollutant.\" He canceled Keystone XL shortly after taking office but has so far declined to intervene against Line 3, and his Department of Justice has defended the project in court.\"When I think about how much carbon is going to be emitted by this, I actually literally feel nauseous,\" Triplett told ABC News.ABC NewsThe tar sands of Alberta, Canada, produce the oil that is transported in the Line 3 pipeline.Line 3 could emit between 35 and 193 million tons of CO2 annually, according to the project's environmental impact statement -- the latter being the equivalent of 45 new coal-fired power plants coming online or 38 million cars being added to the road, according to multiple independent scientists.\"If this pipeline is going to run and bring these tar sands oil to market, we have a much more even massive job to do, reducing emissions elsewhere,\" Triplett said.Enbridge argues that if the pipeline weren't built, oil would have to get to market through even more carbon-intensive means such as truck or rail lines.Triplett says there are road maps for how the U.S. can transition to a lower carbon emissions economy. \"But none of those plans include building a brand new big pipeline to bring tar sands oil to market,\" she said. \"That's not part of any transition. That's terrifying.\"Dividing communities in its pathOn the ground, the project has divided local indigenous communities in its path. Three tribes -- the Red Lake Nation, the White Earth Nation and the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe -- have opposed the project throughout and sued to halt construction. The tribes say the project violates their treaty rights and fear the pipeline will eventually leak, contaminating sacred waters and vital wild rice beds.Two other local tribes -- the Fond du Lac Band and Leech Lake Band -- came to agreements with Enbridge to allow Line 3 to pass through their reservations.  They also agreed not to oppose the project, in exchange for an undisclosed sum of money and promises of future infrastructure investments, according to local reports. As of May 2021, Enbridge says it has spent $250 million with Tribal nations, communities and contractors.Enbridge's agreement with the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe included removing most of the old Line 3 pipeline from the reservation and building the new pipeline on lands to the south. Details of the agreement are not public, but the Bemidji Pioneer reported that Enbridge agreed to a broad commitment with the tribe to work on green energy projects.MORE: Line 3 pipeline resistance continues as activists ask Biden admin to shutdown projectThe Leech Lake Band did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.In the case of the Fond du Lac Band -- which originally opposed the project -- leaders say the tribe was put in an difficult position after Minnesota authorities forced them to choose between allowing the pipeline to run along its existing route through the reservation or agreeing to a route south of the reservation that would still cut through treaty territory, where tribal citizens hunt, fish and gather.\"There is no perfect outcome here,\" tribal council Chair Kevin Dupuis Sr. told MPR News at the time of the deal. \"All remaining options threaten the environment for all, and livelihood of the Indigenous people of Minnesota.\"Fond du Lac member Rob Abramowski, who grew up on the reservation and has worked on Enbridge projects for years, including Line 3, welcomed the project.ABC NewsFond du Lac tribal member Robert Abramowski is among the approximately 500 Native American workers employed by the Line 3 project, according to Enbridge.\"Enbridge went out of their way to encourage Native people to work on the pipeline,\" said Abramowski, who is one of the approximately 500 Native Americans out of the roughly 4,000 temporary workers Enbridge hired to construct Line 3, according to the company.Abramowski says the jobs are more than just temporary. \"Because of the experience that they're gaining here today, they can carry that as far as they want,\" he told ABC News. Abramowski believes the new pipeline will be safer and less likely to spill, but most important to him is that his tribe appears to now have a seat at the table.\"The major part is that my reservation leaders have a say in what happens here, not only today, but in the future,\" he said.Other Fond du Lac members see it differently.\"The Fond du Lac Band cannot speak for all of the other Anishinaabe Nations,\" Taysha Martineau, a fellow Fond Du Lac member and prominent Line 3 opponent told ABC News.ABC NewsFond du Lac tribal member Taysha Martineau is among the generations of indigenous people who have harvested wild rice on lakes in Northern Minnesota.\"When they approved Line 3, and they started construction, they took away the voice of the wider nation,\" Martineau said.The Fond du Lac Band Tribal Business Council declined ABC News' request for an interview and did not respond to a request for comment.Houska, who comes from a small town in Northern Minnesota, co-founded one of the groups most known for conducting direct actions: Camp Namewag. A former intern at the Obama White House and later Native American Affairs Adviser to the Bernie Sanders campaign, Houska says she's \"participated in the process as much as anyone.\"\"What I observed over time was a process that was so incremental in its approach, that was incredibly inefficient in addressing existential problems like a habitable planet to live on,\" she said.Spills, past and presentEnbridge pipelines have resulted in two of the largest inland oil spills in American history. In 2010, an Enbridge pipeline dumped nearly 1 million gallons of tar sands oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River in Michigan, as Enbridge pipeline controllers ignored repeated leak warnings for 17 hours before shutting down the pipeline, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.Enbridge CCO Mike Fernandez says the company spent $5 million cleaning up the spill and learned valuable lessons that resulted in hiring and training more staff. \"It was a big wake-up call for us as a company,\" he said.However, incidents during the construction of Line 3 have opponents feeling less than optimistic. Minnesota authorities have reported 28 known drilling fluid spills during construction, including a spill at the headwaters of the Mississippi. Enbridge was also fined $3.3 million for illegally piercing an aquifer in January, which resulted in the loss of at least 24 million gallons of water.ABC NewsThe Line 3 pipeline crosses the headwaters of the Mississippi River in Northern Minnesota, the site of one of 28 drilling fluid spills that occurred during construction.\"We were drilling, we found the problem. We took the problem to the State Department of Natural Resources,\" Fernandez told ABC News. \"They assessed a fine and we are going to pay it.\"Despite the project coming online this month, opposition groups have vowed to continue to fight Line 3, saying that their efforts have forced the fossil fuel industry to expect heightened resistance in the years to come.\"They know that we are a threat to their bottom line. And that Indigenous resistance and all of the people who feel inspired by that resistance is very threatening,\" Houska said.\"I think we're that stubborn thorn that just won't go away. I mean, I think it's pretty reflective of native people generally,\" she said.  \"We underwent genocide, then cultural genocide, then displacement or removal. We're still here after all that. And we aren't going away.\"",

            "The simple fact is that as long as oil is necessary, it will have to be withdrawn from the ground and transported.\n\n\n\n\nWe are not going to a fossil fuel free future anytime soon. It is delusional to believe otherwise. So, in the meantime, we still need someone to drill or mine for the oil. And transporting that oil via pipeline is the safest way available.\n\n\n\n\nBut radical environmentalists and socialists don't want to accept this reality. They want to stop all production and transportation of oil NOW, despite the effects such a stoppage has on the average person's life and the economy.\n\n\n\n\nEvery action taken against our domestic oil production means American has to buy more from foreign sources. That only hurts our economy, but it is the only option we have if Biden lessens our domestic supply.\n\n\n\n\nPolitical calculations and the socialist agenda of destroying America from within are what truly drives this controversy. Don't ever forget that. Particularly the next time you go fill up your gas tank or when you go to heat your home this winter and get the bill for it  and are stunned at the price. .",
            "So please explain how socialism has anything at all to do with this pipeline?  PS -> I didn't turn my heat on once this past winter, we did have a few days where I could turn the A/C off though and that was nice.",
            "Per the communist dogma established by Marx and Engels--their plan is to destroy capitalism from within by turning the \"classes\" against one another.\n\n\nThe American socialists have adopted this philosophy and their agenda is to disrupt and eventually destroy everything that contributes to America's wealth and power. By losing energy independence, we are placing our entire economy in the hands of foreign countries. \n\n\n\nThat is EXACTLY what socialists want! Note that Biden moved to shut down the Kee ystone pipeline as soon as he got into office, but now he has asked OPEC to increase oil production to drive down the price American's have to pay for oil. \n\n\n\nSocialists are not your friend. They are part of a worldwide plan to replace capitalism and democracy. Look at what socialism/communism has done to Venezuela, Cuba, China, Russia. That is the future socialists want for the US.",
            "I think you are giving \"the socialists\" far too much credit.  The pipeline thing is all about the people who don't want a pipeline running through their land (don't blame them, I wouldn't want it in my back yard either) and the tree huggers are jumping in because pipelines have histories of popping leaks every so often, and the oil they want to move is apparently the dirtiest of the oils to use.  While your story sounds nice and all, there's no organized movement towards socialism in which this pipeline fits.  I do agree, the lefties are so far left they've about fallen off the edge of the flat earth, but they're anti-pipeline for eco reasons, not for the purpose of \"spreading socialism\".  I don't think the younger generation wants to wield socialism like the dictators do, i.e. make the masses dependent on govt. then use that as leverage to control them.  Instead I think they've all grown up somehow thinking that everyone should given something for nothing and who cares how it's paid for.  So it's socialism insofar as it's the govt. giving people stuff for nothing, but I really think it's just spoiled people who don't understand that giving everything away is bad, as opposed to using it for control.",

        "Text": "William Junior Maxwell II, better known as the rapper Fetty Wap, pleaded not guilty to federal drug charges in a New York court Friday.Maxwell, 30, of Paterson, New Jersey, was arrested Thursday during the Rolling Loud Music Festival in Queens, New York, on charges stemming from a drug-related conspiracy involving heroin and fentanyl, a law enforcement official told ABC News.He was charged with five others, including a New Jersey corrections officer, with conspiring to distribute and possess controlled substances across Long Island and New Jersey.The defendants obtained the drugs on the West Coast and used the United States Postal Service and drivers with hidden vehicle compartments to transport the controlled substances across the country to Suffolk County, where they were stored, according to the indictment.“As alleged, the defendants transported, distributed and sold more than 100 kilograms of deadly and addictive drugs, including heroin and fentanyl, on Long Island, deliberately contributing to the opioid epidemic that has devastated our communities and taken too many lives,” U.S. attorney Breon Peace said.Maxwell was a kilogram-level redistributor for the trafficking organization, prosecutors said.“The fact that we arrested a chart-topping rap artist and a corrections officer as part of the conspiracy illustrates just how vile the drug trade has become,” the FBI’s Michael Driscoll said.Maxwell's lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf during an arraignment at the Central Islip federal court.Federal prosecutors asked that he be detained pretrial, which the defense did not contest.“This defendant is part of an organization that systematically distributed 100 kilograms of fentanyl and heroin across Long Island,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Wenzel said.Prosecutors noted that Maxwell faces a minimum of 10 years in prison if convicted and a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.ABC News has reached out to Maxwell's representatives for comment.The rapper was previously arrested in September 2019 for punching hotel workers at The Mirage in Las Vegas.",

National news is part entertainment, part business, part news. It is not about fairness, it is about viewership and selling ads.. There is very finite time available.\n\nWhat White people don't make the cut? Men. The elderly. The middle aged. The unattractive. The fat. The weird. The criminal. The drug user. The poor. The unhealthy. The overly tatted or pierced. Even then there are still MANY attractive young women going missing that never make the cut. The story line itself has to be compelling. A few months back an African American woman made the national news cut but she was young, college educated, upper middle class and physically stunning. Her story didn't have staying power, few do.

That this phenomenon is becoming less prevalent over the years is chiefly because of progressives pointing it out.

Just your average domestic violence / suicide story. No twists and turns just a guy getting overly upset and then killing his partner then himself.

        "Text": "This report is a part of \"Rethinking Gun Violence,\" an ABC News series examining the level of gun violence in the U.S. -- and what can be done about it.​​Darien Richardson, a 25-year-old woman in Maine, was sleeping in her apartment when armed intruders burst in and shot her several times in January 2010.Her boyfriend survived the incident, but after weeks in the hospital, she died the following month due to complications from her gunshot wounds, Portland police said.Finding her assailant seemed possible when authorities discovered that the handgun used to shoot her was apparently recovered at the scene of another murder, according to her family and news reports. But they were not able to trace it to the person who shot Darien.Courtesy Judi RichardsonDarien Richardson, 25, who was shot in her apartment in Portland, Maine in January 2010. She died on Feb. 28, 2010, from complications of her gunshot wounds.\"A sad and unfortunate twist in this case is that a little more than a month after Darien and her boyfriend were shot, the same gun was used in a murder on Park Avenue here in Portland,\" Portland Police Assistant Chief Vernon Malloch told the Bangor Daily News in 2012. \"That case is solved. We recovered the firearm. We know that it’s the same gun that killed both people. Unfortunately, we don’t know where the gun came from.\"Watch ABC News Live on Mondays at 3 p.m. to hear more about gun violence from experts during roundtable discussions. And check back next week, when we look at why gun violence surged during the pandemic.The person who pulled the trigger remains a mystery in part due to a major loophole in the nation’s gun background check system: a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) investigation traced the gun back to a private sale at a Maine gun show, where the first owner sold it to someone he didn’t know, without a background check and without any record of the sale, the Bangor Daily News reported authorities said.Even though they have the murder weapon, they don’t have the piece that they need -- where did that gun come from?Not only did the loophole make the crime harder to solve, but it may also have made it easier for the crime to be committed in the first place.Robert F. Bukaty/AP, FILEJudi Richardson, a citizen sponsor of a ballot initiative to require background checks for gun buyers, wears wrist bands bearing the names and places of victims of gun violence, at her home in South Portland, Maine, Oct. 26, 2017. Richardson's daughter Darien, in photo at left, died after being shot by an intruder in her apartment in 2010 in Portland, Maine.Portland Police told ABC News they couldn’t presently comment on any evidentiary issues in the case and that the department has been in contact with the Richardson family in order to help solve Darien's murder.\"We lost one of the most precious things we have in our lives. Darien is irreplaceable and it’s devastating, but on top of that, this crime has never been solved,\" Darien’s mother, Judi Richardson, told ABC News. \"Even though they have the murder weapon, they don’t have the piece that they need -- where did that gun come from?\"\"We have background checks, so why do we have a loophole that lets so many guns get through?\" she added.MORE: Inside the rise of AR-15-style rifles in AmericaIn order to sell a gun, all U.S. licensed gun dealers must run a potential purchaser through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, a provision based in a federal law that was passed in 1993.Those ineligible to purchase guns include people with criminal records, addicts of any controlled substance, certain people with a history of mental illness, those illegally in the U.S., those dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces and subjects of domestic violence-related protective orders.Even with the loopholes that exist, background checks keep guns from being legally sold to some of those most likely to commit crimes with them.That is why for years, many lawmakers and advocates have rallied for passing universal background checks to expand federal law to include private purchases. Such a bill was introduced and passed in the House in March and awaits Senate action. Another bill, also passed in the House in March, seeks to extend the waiting period for background checks to 10 days.But while universal background checks are often made out to be a panacea for curbing gun violence, there is mixed data about their efficacy.Experts in the public health field say lawmakers have been too fixated on background checks as a one-way ticket to safer streets. In reality, gun violence requires a more complex, multi-faceted approach, they say.Still, experts agree that if loopholes in the system were closed as a part of a more comprehensive strategy to reduce gun violence, background checks would be significantly more effective in curbing gun injuries, deaths and firearm trafficking.Background check loopholesAn estimated 22% of gun owners acquired a firearm without a background check in the U.S. from 2013 to 2015, according to a 2017 Annals of Internal Medicine study.Today’s gaping loopholes in federal law allow people to purchase or transfer guns without a background check at gun shows, private sales, or online.Beyond private purchase sales, one of the major gaps in the system is the \"boyfriend loophole,\" which bars domestic violence abusers from obtaining guns but only applies to current or former marital spouses, current or former cohabitants or someone who shares a child with the victim.Logan Cyrus/AFP via Getty Images, FILEA man stops to observe the makeshift memorial in front of Mother Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston, S.C., Jan. 4, 2017. A gunman opened fire after sitting through a bible study meeting at the church, June 17, 2015, killing nine people.Then there's what has come to be known as the Charleston loophole, which allows gun sellers to proceed with a sale if the FBI investigation for a background check takes more than three days. This is how convicted shooter Dylan Roof, despite his criminal record, purchased the firearm he used in the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina massacre that killed nine worshippers at a historic African American church. Roof was convicted on 33 federal charges in 2016 and sentenced to nine life sentences.This week, The Department of Justice announced a settlement with the victims' families, who had sued the federal government in 2016 because Roof was allowed to purchase a gun despite his prior criminal history.The 2020 Catch-22Despite these loopholes, in 2020 the FBI background check system stopped a record number of more than 300,000 illegal gun sales -- and about 42% of those denials were to people with felony convictions, according to FBI data.Rob Wilcox, the federal legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun violence prevention organization, said that’s proof the background check system works.\"That shows clearly that the system can work in preventing individuals who shouldn't have guns from getting them,\" Wilcox told ABC News.MORE: House passes 2 gun sale background check billsBut while there were record firearm purchase stoppages in 2020, the year was one of the deadliest on record for gun violence with more than 40,000 lives lost from guns, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks shooting incidents through public data, news reports and other sources. Of those, over 19,000 were from homicides, murders and unintentional shootings, and over 24,000 were from suicide.The grim numbers show that even though background checks can work to an extent, gun violence will ensue if other measures aren’t put in place.We have to stop thinking that we have quick fixes, because we could pass a national background check law tomorrow and the impact will be minimal.Today, 22 states have their own universal background check laws that extend beyond federal law to include private sales and transfers. Some states require purchasers to receive a permit or a license, which includes a background check, to even purchase a gun.William Campbell/Corbis via Getty Images, FILEA licensed gun dealer works on a federal background check on a buyer at a gun show in Livingston, Mont., Feb. 7, 2016.However, even in places where loopholes are less prevalent, research on the impact of universal background check requirements has yielded mixed results as to whether they reduce gun violence.Questionable Impact A 2019 study by Boston University and Harvard University medical researchers found that U.S. states with universal background checks for all gun sales had homicide rates 15% lower than states without such laws over a 26-year period.  An analysis of 18 gun control policies by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit global policy think tank, that evaluated existing research found background checks may decrease violent crime. The analysis also found \"moderate evidence\" that dealer background checks may reduce firearm homicide, but evidence of the impact of private-seller background checks on firearm homicides was inconclusive.Other studies indicate universal background checks don’t make much of a difference at all.A University of California, Davis study that observed the impact of California’s mandate for comprehensive background checks for nearly all firearms sales since 1991 found no change in the rates of firearm homicide or suicide through 2000. Those researchers conducted another study that found the repeal of comprehensive background check laws in Tennessee and Indiana had no effect on gun homicides or suicide rates in those states.Still, Dr. Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said there’s \"pretty robust research evidence\" showing background checks make a great impact when coupled with licensing laws (which require people to have a license issued by local authorities to buy, own, possess a gun), and result in \"significant reductions in homicides, suicides, shootings of law enforcement officers in the line of duty, mass shootings, [and] diversions of guns from legal to illegal use.\"Of course, statewide background checks may not measure up against what could be achieved with a national law requiring universal background checks. As it stands, even states with the strictest rules for who can purchase a gun can be impacted by cross-state-line firearm trafficking from states with looser rules.\"Guns that are trafficked between states nearly always originate from states without strong background check laws,\" Wilcox, of Everytown, said. \"In the case of Chicago, 60% of the crime guns that are recovered come from out of state, a significant number coming from neighboring Indiana, which does not have laws requiring background checks,\" he said, citing data from Chicago’s 2017 Gun Trace Report.Keith Srakocic/AP, FILESemi-automatic handguns are displayed at shop in New Castle, Pa., March 25, 2020.While supporters of universal background checks say they reduce gun violence by keeping guns out of the wrong hands and would help to shrink the black market, others argue that most criminals get their guns illegally anyway and would continue to find a path to do so. The National Rifle Association is among those voices that argue universal background checks would have little impact on criminality.\"FBI data makes clear the majority of criminals get their guns from the black market, straw purchase (where a person who is unable to pass a background check uses a proxy buyer to purchase the firearm for them), theft, or other sources that don’t involve a background check. Therefore, any claim that background checks will decrease crime rates lacks merit,\" a spokesperson for the NRA told ABC News.Background checks are not the 'end-all, be-all solution'While background checks aren’t perfect, supporters believe they’re a start. On a large scale, applicants with criminal histories being denied gun purchases lowers the risk for future violent offenses, Webster said, citing a 2019 study.But background checks are far from \"the end-all and be-all to the problem” of gun violence, Howard Spivak, the former director of the Division of Violence Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told ABC News.We didn’t eliminate cars, we did things to make things safer. We changed the design, we added airbags, we implemented safety strategies. There’s safety strategies that could be implemented with guns as well.He said the gun violence epidemic needs to be looked at from a public health perspective, which combines laws like background checks and waiting periods, as well as \"underlying mental health issues that may contribute to risk of firearm violence.\"That includes training gun dealers to recognize signs of depression, educating gun sellers to look for warning signs of instability or violence, and increasing awareness of the risks of having guns in one's home, Spivak said.Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILEAn attendee wears a \"Background Checks Saves Lives\" sticker during the unveiling of legislation to expand background checks for sales of firearms in Washington, D.C., Jan. 8, 2019.\"Some of it has to do with changing behavior and attitudes and values around conflict, some of it has to do with better screening for risk -- it's a combination of all of those things that can reduce gun violence,\" he said.MORE: America has a gun violence problem. What do we do about it?Linda Degutis, the former director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC, said the nation should respond to gun violence in a \"comprehensive\" way, similar to how the country responded to drunk driving and the opioid crisis.\"There were a number of laws that were put in place, it wasn’t just one, and it automatically made a difference,\" she said of the drunk driving issue. \"So we saw a decline in crash deaths and injuries because of the multiple strategies that we used … We didn’t eliminate cars, we did things to make things safer. We changed the design, we added airbags, we implemented safety strategies. There’s safety strategies that could be implemented with guns as well,\" she said.She compared focusing on background checks alone to approaching the opioid epidemic without dealing with addiction.\"Some of the early efforts around opioid addiction was at reducing access to opioids through prescriptions. It didn't reduce addiction, it drove people who were addicted into the black market of drugs,\" Degutis said. \"It was too narrow of a focus, it wasn't dealing with addiction, it was just dealing with one avenue of access to drugs, ignoring the fact that there were other access points. And the more you drive people away from the legal access points, the less control you have.\"She and Spivak told ABC News there needs to be different public messaging on the safety of guns, the threat they pose in households, safe storage and assuring the mental health of gun owners, especially as 60% of gun deaths are suicides, according to CDC data from 2019.\"We have to stop thinking that we have quick fixes, because we could pass a national background check law tomorrow and the impact will be minimal,\" Spivak said. \"It's only one piece of a much bigger set of things we have to be doing.\"Still a main focusDespite calls for a more comprehensive approach to ending gun violence, background checks continue to be a main focus. Part of that may be because they are overwhelmingly supported, with 81% of Americans across all political stripes in favor of expanding checks to include private and gun show sales, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center survey.In contrast, other divisive gun policies -- such as concealed carry permits, allowing teachers to be armed and banning assault-style weapons and high capacity magazines -- see much more of a dramatic split among lawmakers, according to Pew.Star Tribune via Getty Images, FILEJessica Kllingler holds a Gun Owners Caucus sign during the House public safety meeting about expanding background checks, at the State Capitol in St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 27, 2019.Some of the nation’s top police leaders have also voiced support for universal background checks. In March, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, a network of police executives representing the 79 largest cities in the U.S. and Canada, addressed the spike in crime across the U.S. over the past years and called for \"establishing a strong system for universal background checks to cover all firearm purchases\" and close the internet sale and gun show loopholes.\"It will be challenging to truly address the gun violence threat without closing these loopholes since guns will continue to be sold to those who are not permitted under the law to possess one,\" the group said in a statement.MORE: Why the Second Amendment may be overstated in the gun debateNearly 10 years on, Darien Richardson’s family continues to fight for universal background checks.In her case, while a background check may not have prevented the shooter from getting their hands on a gun and killing her in the first place, it would have at least put the sale on record and made it easier to trace it back to the shooter. For that, her family feels like it's an appropriate place to start.\"It's gotten worse, even since we got involved and that was 10 years ago,\" Judi said. \"What's it going to take?\"ABC News' Luke Barr contributed to this report.",

            "I'd check to see if your state is actually using the FBI database.  I believe CA and NY use their own databases.  I know both states REGISTER the firearm to the owner.  Not sure how that exactly prevents a crime.  They may be able to match it to your gun with ballistics as they both require a spent round from the manufacturer.\nNICS supposedly only has a database of those who should be DENIED a firearm.  It's derived from the NCIC database which is supposed to be updated by all states and federal entities.  It breaks down when a state doesn't update NCIC on a conviction or one of the entities that is supposed to report things like dishonorable discharge, minor drug convictions, or mental health findings.  I'm not sure how a 5-10 day waiting period would find anything new/different than the instant check short of contacting law enforcement departments directly.  The \"biggest\" issue, claimed by some, is lack of funding for smaller jurisdictions to report \"disabling\" items to NCIC.  Places like \"Mayberry\" supposedly don't have the manpower/time.\n\nPersonally any time I've transferred a firearm to someone I've either used an FFL or the police department.  That way I have a record of both the transfer AND that it was legal for them to have a firearm at the time of transfer.  Even your best life long friend may have something barring legal possession no matter how big their collection of arms are.",
            "All those people denied a legal gun purchase by a back ground check will simply find another way. Many felons on release acquire a firearm because they are paranoid about others like themselves or previous associates.",
            "\"All those people denied a legal gun purchase by a back ground check will simply find another way\"  All those DENY results should be investigated... \"In 2017, just 12 of the 112,000 people denied a gun purchase, about 0.01%, were federally prosecuted, largely due to limited resources for the time-intensive investigations, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report.Jun 22, 2021\"  ABCNEWS meanwhile another 300 of those 112k successfully appealed the DENY.",
            "The people I mentioned in the last post.  You can see some of them posting here.  You can see others introducing background check legislation",
            "Good idea. I feel a lot of criminals would stop short of letting you see and picture their ID so I'm sure it helps.\n\nMy state requires background checks on all transfers so I got used to meeting buyers at the pawn shop and letting them do the full background check. At first I was skeptical, but after a few times it's really just a minor inconvenience and worth it because I know the person getting my firearm is not a felon. I will say I wish there were a few small changes, like maybe letting someone use the same background check for multiple purchases in the same 30-day period, or at the very least the same day.",
            "How about not charging a fee for the background check?  How about only requiring a background check for a buyer who owns no firearms?\n\nThe absence of those two qualities reveals the stupidity and malice behind most background check laws.  They aren't intended to reduce crime, the real intention is to harass  ordinary gun owners.",
            "I agree there really should be no fee. But just because someone owns a firearm already should not be excuse to avoid a background check. \n\nHonestly keeping firearms out of the hands of not only felons, but those who are mentally unstable is just plain common sense regardless of what anyone on the left or right has to say. Background checks did stop over 300,000 illegal firearm sales in 2020 according to the FBI and stated in the very article we are commenting on. That is a huge potential reduction in crime for what is nothing more than an inconvenience to the \"ordinary gun owner\" such as myself. Calling a trip to the pawn shop \"harassment\" is laughable.",
            "When a policy has only cost and zero benefits, that qualifies as harassment.  Yes it is mere petty harassment, but it's the thought that counts!\n\nFor example, what actual useful purpose is served by requiring a waiting period or background check, if the buyer already has a firearm?  How about 5 firearms?  How about a dozen firearms?  None, that's what.  It is just petty harassment of another 10 days and $35 wasted.  Message received!\n\nAs for the background check numbers, I advise two cautions.  First off those large numbers of denials might not represent prohibited people.  IIRC, the NICS system has a very high rate of false positives, something like 90%.  Secondly, those denials don't mean a prohibited person failed to get a gun, it just means that specific transaction was halted.\n\nThat's all nice and good.  Pat yourself on the back for that one.  But when there is no followup at all to a denial, what prevents that prohibited person from still getting a firearm by other means?  The fact that there is effectively zero enforcement for attempts to illegally buy a firearm, gives the lie to the whole background check system.  What's the point?  It's security theatre.  A speed-bump to criminals getting a gun anyway.",
            "You are obviously in denial because a law you don't like actually works and is backed up by reliable sources. Curious, so you have a source for your claims of \"false positives\" etc? I doubt it because you are just making stuff up at this point.",
            "<blockquote>For gun purchases, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives dropped over 94 percent of “initial denials” after just the first preliminary review. The annual National Instant Criminal Background Check System report explains that these cases were dropped either because the additional information showed that the wrong people had been stopped or because the covered offenses were so many decades old that the government decided not to prosecute. At least a fifth of the remaining 6 percent were still false positives.</blockquote>",
            "About 1% of NICS checks are denied.  From that group of 1% of denials, about 6% are referred for further investigation.  Of those investigations, about 25% are cleared of any wrongdoing.  So how many people finally get prosecuted, out of all those supposedly numerous law breakers?\n\n<blockquote>WASHINGTON – Few gun buyers are ever prosecuted for lying on forms they are required to complete as part of a background check when purchasing a weapon, a new federal study concludes.\n\nIn the 29 states where federal officials handle the background checks, <b>there were only 12 prosecutions </b>in fiscal 2017 of people who were found to have provided false information, such as failing to disclose a felony conviction, according to the Government Accountability Office.\n\nIt is a federal crime for people trying to obtain guns to make a false statement or furnish false or misrepresented identification that is intended to deceive people on the legality of the sale of the firearm. Violators face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.</blockquote>",
            "Your source is about people charged with lying on their background check application. Your statement was about \"false positives\". Where do they relate at all? How does this source back up your claim about all the \"false positives\"?",
            "Jeez, how obtuse!  Think about it.\n\nIf a person told the truth on their 4473, then why did the NICS system reject the sale?  Why would only 6% of NICS rejections merit further investigation, if all the rejections were legitimate?\n\nGood grief, even the investigations indicate a 25% rate of no actual violation occurred!",

            "How about going to an FFL, they are literally everywhere, had paying a small fee to have the NICS done?  I'd be VERY concerned if just anyone could call NICS and get a PROCEED, DENY, DELAY.  Especially since it's usually done based on SSN, Name, Address and date of birth as well as place of birth.  How do I know you as the seller are legally allowed to possess a firearm and aren't simply looking to make a dollar after using the firearm illegally?",
            "Some FFLs don't want to have the responsibility if they aren't selling the gun.\nSometimes there is no available FFL.",
            "As I said, for a small fee.  It's not a responsibility thing if they are running the NICS. It's a time and potential lost sale for most.\nAs for no available FFL... I've gone to a police station to do a transfer... They were more than happy to clear the purchaser.  Perhaps in Montana, the Dakota's or Alaska there isn't an FFL within spitting distance, maybe NYC or Chicago as well but both of those require police involvement for a legal purchase anyhow.",
            "RIght...  for a small fee.   Said FFL may not want to do it for that small amount. Currently, the average price s $25-$50 for doing so.\n\nIf you live in rural areas, you don't want to travel to find said FFL.  And that one might not want to do it.\n\nIt is a responsibility thing. If the gun is sold via the FFL, he still needs to log the transaction and keep it on his log books. \nTHAT is why the Democrats don't want civilian access to the NICS.\nThis is a control matter.",
            "IF the state/feds mandate universal background checks then the FFL will have to do some... between their FFL and business license the government has a bit of influence\n\"And that one might not want to do it.\"  they have this thing called a phone.  Last I checked FFL have listed numbers.\n\"THAT is why the Democrats don't want civilian access to the NICS.\"  Actually the gun grabbers are the ones who DO want access to NICS.  I'm registered GOP as Independents don't get much say in the primaries.  I'm opposed to just anyone/civilians having access to NICS.\nAs for the FFL logging the transaction... um that's part of the 4473 process.  The parties involved in the transfer would be responsible for completing their portions.

An army 45 and a walters ppk 32.\n\nMy brother turned to the drug world. In deep. I got some wild stories about that.\n\nKnowing drugs and guns don't mix. I went to his house and took his guns.\n\nHe was reluctant at first. I told him either I take them or the police.\n\nI bought a lockbox put the guns in the box and put it in the back of the closet. Never touched the box for over 5 years when my brother came and asked for them back. He guaranteed he was all straighten out and drugs were no longer a problem.\n\nOf course I didn't believe him. Drug users lie daily.\n\nI wouldn't give them back.\n\nI investigated. Called his wife, his friends. All assured me he was clean.\n\nI have hooks in the police department. I called a friend in the department. Asked him to look up my brother for police contact. During the drug years there was quite a lot. However, there were non towards the current time.\n\nI still kept the guns for 6 months and reconfirmed my sources.\n\nI gave the guns back. No problem since.\n\nI was an illegal gun holder for 5 plus years.\n\n--\n\nMy older brothers son (30's) lived in a southern state 4 or 5 years and legally bought a hand gun. Moved to NY. Knowingly failed to register the gun in NY. Got pulled over for speeding and somehow the gun was discovered. 5 years in the prison system.\n\nRemember I said I had hooks. High up in the command. I made the call. Response was, \"I can't touch this with a 10 foot pole. Sorry.\" This was during the Sandy Hook shootings. Gun possession was in the news hourly. No way the system would look light on guns.\n\nAt the end of it all. He got no sympathy from me or from his father. He knew he had to register the gun in NY. He was too lazy to do so.\n\n.",

            "I did review my post you are correct. Cruz did pass the current background check.\n\nMy point was (but not clear) that posters are posting today that background check is unnecessary..

            "I believe, if you read the posters comments below, they are against background checks for private sales. That is the transfer of personal property between two residents of the same state in which the transaction occurs (if that exchange crosses a state line in any way, a federal check is already required). \nI am certain that one of their objections is that the Fed lacks the Constitutional authority to enact such a regulatory scheme. The Fed does not have the authority to regulate the sale of personal property between two residents of the same state in which the transaction occurs.\n\nAnother is that, if you are truly interested in having a \"Universal Background Check\" and it is not based upon \"gaining government control,\" there is a very simple way to do it. \nOpen the NICS system for public use. An individual would have the ability to get a background check performed on a prospective buyer without the cost, and inconvenience, of having to use an FFL to perform that check for them.  Of course, that idea is quickly shot down by those that wish to use the UBC as a convenient stepping stone to enact other laws to support that system when it is shown to be a spectacular failure (ie: registration of legally owned personal property).\n\nYet another objection is based on the logical question of how it would actually work. For the sake of making the point, let's assume that I own an AK-47.  I purchased the rifle through a private sale some 10 years ago. No bill of sale. No paperwork whatsoever. The seller was an single gentleman that I was friends with, who has has since passed.  \nA person that I know from work (and is known to me to not be a \"prohibited possessor\" since he has an extensive collection purchased from all over the country) has expressed an interest in buying the rifle from me. We meet in the back parking lot, and an exchange is made. \nHow does government prove I ever owned that particular rifle? \nThat I sold that particular rifle? \nThat I sold that rifle after the \"Universal background check\" law came into effect?\nKeep in mind that there is no paper trail for that rifle, beyond the initial purchase 15 years ago, and that owner has since died.\n\nAs far as adding \"behavioral\" background check, that exists in the current background check system. \nThat behavior is: \n1: convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\n2: fugitive from justice\n3: unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act, codified at 21 U.S.C. § 802) (NOTE: Even if your state has deregulated marijuana, it remains a Federally regulated substance. If you use it, you are a \"prohibited person\")\n4: adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution\n5: illegal alien\n6: dishonorable discharge from the military\n7: subject to a court order restraining the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of the intimate partner\n8: convicted of a misdemeanor domestic assault\n9: renounced your US Citizenship\nAll of the above have something in common. They all involve due process and adjudication. To deny a citizen the free exercise of their rights requires that due process be followed. Hearsay does not apply.\n\nThe fact that the Police ignored (your number) 39 calls involving Cruz points to a governmental problem. The Police did not do their sworn duty to protect and serve (likely at the direction of their superiors, and the government for which they work). \nThe same thing is responsible for the Texas church shooting as well. The Military did not report the dishonorable discharge, or the domestic assault conviction, of the shooter to the FBI for inclusion into the NICS system. \nParkland only points to an inept government, as does the Texas church shooting. Neither of those shootings demonstrate a failure of the background check system. Both of those show a failure of the government agencies involved previous to those shootings. \nParkland most certainly should not be viewed as supporting a change to the background check system in any way. The background check system worked as designed, using the information reported by responsible government agencies across the country.\nWhat do you propose to do to ensure that all government agencies perform their required duty to support the existing (and any future) system? \n\nI have yet to encounter anyone that laughed when Parkland occurred, or laughed about anything to do with that event...or cheered in any way because of that event. Your suppositions are nothing more than your bias boiling over into your comments.",

People can afford to pay $15 for a background check.\n\nEdit: to answer your question of “what is the upside?“\n\nIt makes it more difficult for people to buy guns, which would logically eliminate  some, but not all gun crimes. \n\n Also, it makes it easier for police to track guns after crimes have been committed.",

You see the problem with this type of logic?",
            "the constitution protects existing rights from the government, and the 2A is perhaps the most explicitly clear in that sense. we all agree that regulation is not prohibited, but fees are considered disenfranchisement. heck, requiring an ID is considered an infringement on voting rights. we also generally agree that rights are not only for those who can afford them, and requiring a fee to exercise constitutionally protected rights will disproportionately affect and disenfranchise poorer individuals. \n\nsome rights are conferred at adulthood. you do bring up another interesting comparison between equally important rights, and what the real age of adulthood should be. if 18 is an adult then that individual should have the liberty to buy cigs, buy beer, buy a firearm, vote, etc. if it's 21, then it should be 21 for rights and liberties we give to adults.",
            "That’s not a good argument. For starters, people have to buy guns in the first place. \n\nAnd I don’t think anyone can recently argue that a $15 registration fee on a $700 item constitutes “disenfranchisement.“",
            "relative amount is irrelevant to the concept. you may think it's a bad argument due to your personal opinion on the matter, but if you fully believe in the bill of rights it does matter\n\nin your opinion, is it disenfranchisement to prove your identity to vote? or any of the other \"controversial\" voting actions recently enacted i.e. not being allowed to vote in a different precinct, standard voting hours, etc?",
            "I’m not going to address the voter question less it comes up in a separate article. But to your other point: it’s not about the concept, it’s about the fax. $15 doesn’t even constitute 10% of most gun sales.

            "You’re not addressed my argument that the Supreme Court has often valued  the interest of public well-being over governmental intrusion.\n\nThere is a strong public interest in having guns remain only in the hands those legally able to own one. \n\n$15 is a form of regulation to do that. \nAnd what happens to your argument if the government t allows people to apply for financial aid?  If people can demonstrate a financial hardship, then the government will subsidize some or all of that fee.",
            "i've addressed it every time I give you a 1:1 comparison. there's a strong public interest in an individual's vote not being cancelled out by a fraudulent one too.\n\nmy argument would be null and void if the government allowed civilians to access NICS and conduct a BG check themselves. no need to have a fee at all, and no need for taxpayers to foot the bill to subsidize the gov't fee.",

But a series of clerical errors and missteps allowed Roof to buy the handgun he later used in the massacre.\n\nThe errors included wrongly listing the sheriff’s office as the arresting agency in the drug case, according to court documents. An examiner with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System found some information on the arrest but needed more to deny the sale, so she sent a fax to a sheriff’s office. The sheriff’s office responded it didn’t have the report, directing her to the Columbia police.\n\n\nUnder the system’s operating procedures, the examiner was directed to a federal listing of law enforcement agencies, but Columbia police did not appear on the list. After trying the separate West Columbia Police Department and being told it was the wrong agency, the examiner did nothing more.\n\nAfter a three-day waiting period, Roof went back to a West Columbia store to pick up the handgun.",

Ellis is accused of assaulting KC Robinson, the son of Olney head coach Kirk Robinson.Rachel CarrollKC Robinson and his father Kirk Robinson are pictured on the field at an Olney Bears game in Maryland in 2021.The Carroll County Youth Football League to which both teams belong told ABC News that the executive board launched an investigation last month that's so far led to the expulsion or suspension of several individuals associated with both teams.\"As additional details emerge the CCYFL will continue to evaluate and take further actions as necessary,\" the executive board said in a statement to ABC News. \"The League has a zero-tolerance policy for any physical altercations on its sidelines and unfortunately the decisions made by a few adults has impacted the season.\"Rachel CarrollOlney Bears player KC Robinson talks to his father Kirk Robinson, head coach of the Olney Bears, at a game against the North Carroll Colts at Christmas Tree Park in Manchester, Md., Sept. 25, 2021.The league would not disclose the names of those who faced disciplinary action, but Kirk Robinson confirmed that he was one of them.According to Robinson, he initially was suspended for two games for using foul language during the game after he disagreed with a refereeing decision, but later he was banned for life from coaching in the league or attending games.How two fathers and their teenage sons are talking about race in AmericaRobinson told ABC News he thinks that decision is unfair because he was defending his family.\"My job is to protect the kids that are on the field ... and I'm paying the consequences for it,\" he added. \"You can't tell me that any adult is going to be OK with -- whether their child's Black or white -- being assaulted by another adult.\"Robinson's wife, Amanda Robinson, told ABC News she witnessed the alleged assault against the first child.Rachel CarrollKirk Robinson, head coach of the Olney Bears, is pictured at one of the team's games in 2021.LaTasha Robinson, KC Robinson's mother, said that following confrontations involving Ellis, Lockner and parents of Olney players, there was pushing and shoving as they walked through the crowd. Amid the commotion, she said KC fell to the ground after he was allegedly assaulted by Ellis.\"He was upset, he was hurt,\" LaTasha Robinson said. \"You don't just swing into a crowd and there's kids there.\"Allegations of racismSeveral individuals associated with the Olney team who were present at the game, including family members of the two 13-year-olds who were allegedly assaulted, claimed that their children were subjected to racial slurs by North Carroll players and parents.Tamisha, the sister of the first child who was allegedly assaulted, told ABC News that her brother was crying so hard afterward that he \"couldn't even catch his breath.\"Tamisha said that her brother scored two touchdowns, and as tensions were getting high before the scuffle broke out, he and his teammates were being taunted throughout the game by individuals associated with North Carroll.\"I went over to him originally ... and I just asked him if he was OK, and he said, 'They're calling me the N-word, they're calling us the N-word, They're taunting us.' And I said, don't worry about that, go to your coaches, just stay with them,\" she said.Rachel CarrollThe Olney Bears play against the North Carroll Colts at Christmas Tree Park in Manchester, Md., Sept. 25, 2021.Hess told ABC News there is no evidence of racial slurs on various spectator videos obtained by police, but it's unclear how much footage is out there and the criminal case is still open.North Carroll Rec Council President Andy Kiler told ABC News on Sunday that the North Carroll Colts executive board took disciplinary action against several individuals, but \"racist remarks have not been found, which includes an investigation by police that included video and conversations with those at the event.\"\"NCRC takes all accusations of any type of discrimination very seriously, and we do not tolerate that type of behavior within our programs,\" he added. \"Our review has concluded unless new information is brought to our attention.\"",

But never, ever, do they say, a Black man robbed a White man, a Black man gropped a White woman walking down the street. \nIt's always a \"Man\" robbed someone or a man was caught on video groping a woman. \n\nRace is only relevant to ABC \"journalist\" when they can attack Whites in their story, and notice by the way they will always capitalize every race but WHITE? That too is done to diminish a race of people, to deny their importance compared to all other races, they are NOT EQUAL in the minds of journalist. \n\nSo, there are race claims here and a lot videos were taken of the exchanges and one element is missing from the videos, race. The claims don't seem to be backed up by the videos so far. \n\nHowever, after reviewing the videos and interviews with people, at least one Black coach has been banned from even attending anymore games. Clearly, the league does not agree this was a one sided racial attack. \n\nI live in Northern California, there used to be a football team from the Bay Area with a violent reputation, the team was mostly Black. Several games ended in brawls they started. I went to one game, where safety protocols were in place, fans were told to seperate, the police would only allow one side to leave first, any fight and the game is called. \n\nSure enough, a fight, the mostly Black team was told to leave, they and their fans were escorted out first while the mostly White team and all the fans were ordered to stay until it was safe. Then the police allowed the mostly White team and fans to go to their cars. \n\nYou don't think ABC would cover \"Blacks assault Whites during game and had to be escorted out of town\" do you? \n\nA better question is, WOULD ABC EVER print such language? No, because they have a race baiting agenda that only serves to harm one race, the one they refuse to capitalize.",

The worst that happened to mine was in a youth basketball game. My ten-year-old went up for the rebound and a bigger kid on the opposing team took a deliberate run at him and slammed him off the court. He literally flew into the wall, which thankfully was covered by a tumbling mat. The coach went and checked him out, and I could see that he was okay, but the opposing team’s coach was banned from the league that day. It had been clear throughout the game that he was encouraging undue roughness and overall dirty play. Everyone on our side was horrified, but there was no parental melee as in this story. If this behavior had been the norm I would have pulled my kid from the league. \n\nHigh school band parents can also get carried away, but they don’t usually scream and throw things, as that would get the entire band suspended from the contest or game.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- The latest post-Brexit fishing spat between Britain and France showed few signs of abating Monday, a day before a threatened French blockade of British boats and trucks.British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned France that the U.K. will “not roll over” in the face of what she termed “unreasonable” threats from Paris.Both sides have accused each other of contravening the post-Brexit trade deal that the U.K. signed with the European Union, which came into force at the start of this year.France has threatened to bar British boats from some of its ports and tighten checks on boats and trucks carrying British goods if more French vessels aren’t licensed to fish in U.K. waters by Tuesday. Paris has also suggested it might restrict energy supplies to the Channel Islands — British Crown dependencies that lie off the coast of France and are heavily dependent on French electricity.“The French need to withdraw those threats otherwise we will use the dispute resolution mechanism in the EU deal to take action,\" Truss told BBC radio. “We’re simply not going to roll over in the face of these threats.”Fishing is a tiny industry economically, but one that looms large symbolically for both Britain and France, which have a long and cherished maritime tradition. Since the start of the year both sides have control of their waters subject to the terms of the post-Brexit trade deal.Paris says some vessels have been denied permits to fish in waters where they have long sailed. Britain says it has granted 98% of applications from EU vessels, and now the dispute comes down to just a few dozen French boats with insufficient paperwork.“We allocated the fishing licences completely in line with what is in the trade agreement with the EU and the French need to withdraw those threats,” Truss said.On Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leaders summit in Rome, but little progress on resolving the dispute appears to have been made.Macron has warned that unless Britain made a “significant move” to ease the dispute, Paris would introduce more stringent port and border checks from Tuesday.Truss, echoing Johnson, said the U.K. would respond by triggering dispute resolution measures in the post-Brexit trade deal to seek “compensatory measures” if France carries out its threats.The row is the latest to afflict relations between the British government and the EU since since the U.K. left the economic orbit of the bloc at the start of this year.",

These horror stories make the news, and I have seen parents get too carried away—mostly overly invested baseball dads who yelled at and shamed their kids when they didn’t meet Dad’s expectations, but there were only a couple of those. The worst that happened to mine was in a youth basketball game. My ten-year-old went up for the rebound and a bigger kid on the opposing team took a deliberate run at him and slammed him off the court. He literally flew into the wall, which thankfully was covered by a tumbling mat. The coach went and checked him out, and I could see that he was okay, but the opposing team’s coach was banned from the league that day. It had been clear throughout the game that he was encouraging undue roughness and overall dirty play. Everyone on our side was horrified, but there was no parental melee as in this story. If this behavior had been the norm I would have pulled my kid from the league. \n\nHigh school band parents can also get carried away, but they don’t usually scream and throw things, as that would get the entire band suspended from the contest or game.",

        "Text": "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Ethiopia’s prime minister has called on citizens to redouble their efforts to combat the rival Tigray forces who claim to have seized key cities on a major highway leading to the capital, while a new wave of detentions of ethnic Tigrayans has begun.A move on Addis Ababa is a new phase in the war that has killed thousands of people since fighting broke out a year ago between Ethiopian and allied forces and Tigray ones who long dominated the national government before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018.The prime minister’s spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, told The Associated Press on Monday that Abiy “is where he's meant to be, leading the country's front and center.\"Abiy in a statement on Sunday said federal troops are fighting on four fronts against the Tigray forces and “we should know that our enemy’s main strength is our weakness and unpreparedness.” Amid calls on social media for attacks against ethnic Tigrayans, he said “we should closely follow those who work for the enemy and live amongst us.\"A new roundup of Tigrayans was seen in the capital on Monday. Government spokesman Legesse Tulu said in a statement that \"those who believe the government is now weakening and (Tigray forces are) coming should be careful. Some even went to nightclubs to celebrate. The government is taking actions against those.”The Tigray forces over the weekend claimed to control the key cities of Dessie and Kombolcha, though the federal government disputed it, and Legesse asserted that the Tigray forces killed more than 100 youths in Kombolcha overnight.The United States has said it is “alarmed” by the reports of Tigray forces taking the cities.The Tigray forces also told the AP they were poised to physically link up with another armed group, the Oromo Liberation Army, with which it struck an alliance earlier this year.The fighting could reach the Oromo region that neighbors Addis Ababa. Ethnic Oromo once hailed Abiy as the country’s first Oromo prime minister, but discontent has since emerged with the jailing of outspoken Oromo leaders.A top general with the Tigray forces, Tsadkan Gebretensae, told Tigrai TV over the weekend they were ruling out talks with the federal government.The Tigray forces say they are pressuring Ethiopia’s government to lift a months-long blockade on their region of around 6 million people, with basic services cut off and humanitarian food and medical aid denied.The government of the Amhara region, where fighting has been focused since Tigray forces retook much of their own region in June, on Sunday ordered government institutions to stop regular activities and join the war effort. It also banned most activities in cities and towns after 8 p.m.",

But never, ever, do they say, a Black man robbed a White man, a Black man gropped a White woman walking down the street. \nIt's always a \"Man\" robbed someone or a man was caught on video groping a woman. \n\nRace is only relevant to ABC \"journalist\" when they can attack Whites in their story, and notice by the way they will always capitalize every race but WHITE? That too is done to diminish a race of people, to deny their importance compared to all other races, they are NOT EQUAL in the minds of journalist. \n\nSo, there are race claims here and a lot videos were taken of the exchanges and one element is missing from the videos, race. The claims don't seem to be backed up by the videos so far. \n\nHowever, after reviewing the videos and interviews with people, at least one Black coach has been banned from even attending anymore games. Clearly, the league does not agree this was a one sided racial attack. \n\nI live in Northern California, there used to be a football team from the Bay Area with a violent reputation, the team was mostly Black. Several games ended in brawls they started. I went to one game, where safety protocols were in place, fans were told to seperate, the police would only allow one side to leave first, any fight and the game is called. \n\nSure enough, a fight, the mostly Black team was told to leave, they and their fans were escorted out first while the mostly White team and all the fans were ordered to stay until it was safe. Then the police allowed the mostly White team and fans to go to their cars. \n\nYou don't think ABC would cover \"Blacks assault Whites during game and had to be escorted out of town\" do you? \n\nA better question is, WOULD ABC EVER print such language? No, because they have a race baiting agenda that only serves to harm one race, the one they refuse to capitalize.",

My ten-year-old went up for the rebound and a bigger kid on the opposing team took a deliberate run at him and slammed him off the court. He literally flew into the wall, which thankfully was covered by a tumbling mat. The coach went and checked him out, and I could see that he was okay, but the opposing team’s coach was banned from the league that day.

        "Text": "CANBERRA, Australia -- Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison denied that he lied to French President Emmanuel Macron while secretly negotiating a submarine deal with the United States and Britain, an accusation that has escalated a rift over Australia’s surprise cancelation of a French deal.Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce suggested France was overreacting, saying, “we didn’t deface the Eiffel Tower.”Australia in September dropped the 5-year-old, 90 million Australian dollar ($66 million) contract with majority French state-owned Naval Group to build 12 conventional diesel-electric submarines. Instead, Australia formed an alliance with Britain and the U.S. to acquire a fleet of eight nuclear-powered submarines built with U.S. technology.Macron told Australian reporters late Sunday in Rome, where both he and Morrison attended the Group of 20 nations summit, that the new alliance was “very bad news for the credibility of Australia and very bad news for the trust that great partners can have with Australia.”Answering a reporter’s question about whether he thinks Morrison lied to him, Macron replied, “I don’t think, I know” he lied.Morrison said he did not lie to Macron, while senior Australian government ministers criticized the French leader for escalating the dispute through the personal slight.“We didn’t steal an island, we didn’t deface the Eiffel Tower, it was a contract,” Joyce said in the New South Wales town of Moree on Monday.“Contracts have terms and conditions, and one of those terms and conditions and propositions is that you might get out of the contract. We got out of that contract,” Joyce added.Joyce's office could not say whether “steal an island” was a reference to the English Channel’s tiny Sark Island, which unemployed French nuclear physicist André Gardes attempted to overthrow with an assault rifle in 1990.The bizarre event inspired the 2013 movie, “The Man Who Tried to Steal an Island.”Cabinet Minister David Littleproud described Macron’s criticism of Morrison as “unreasonable.”Morrison could not reveal that the United States had offered Australia nuclear-propulsion technology when the two leaders dined together in June for national security reasons, Littleproud said.“I was very clear that the conventional submarines were not going to be able to meet our strategic interests,” Morrison said.Macron refused to take Morrison’s phone calls after the submarine furor broke until hours before the Australian leader was to fly to Rome last week. The pair did not hold a bilateral meeting in Rome, but Morrison said they had “spoken several times\" and would likely do so more in the coming days. Both leaders will attend the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, this week.U.S. President Joe Biden told Macron last week that the U.S. had been “clumsy” in its handling of the Australian submarine alliance. Biden said he thought Macron had been informed long before the deal was announced.Opposition leader Anthony Albanese, who is aiming to become prime minister after elections due by May, said Morrison’s credibility had been tarnished over the submarines controversy.“It’s important that Australians have a leader on the world stage who is trusted on that stage, whose word can be counted,” Albanese said. “But what we see is that being drawn into question very directly by the president of France and also the president of the United States.”Asked by a reporter if Australia could have “handled it better,” Joyce replied, “With hindsight.” He then drew an analogy to the Melbourne Cup, Australia’s best-known horse race, which will be run on Tuesday.“If only I could put a bet on last year’s one, geez, I’d make some money,” Joyce said.———This story corrects that the deputy prime minister spoke at Moree, not Canberra.",

That too is done to diminish a race of people, to deny their importance compared to all other races, they are NOT EQUAL in the minds of journalist. \n\nSo, there are race claims here and a lot videos were taken of the exchanges and one element is missing from the videos, race. The claims don't seem to be backed up by the videos so far. \n\nHowever, after reviewing the videos and interviews with people, at least one Black coach has been banned from even attending anymore games. Clearly, the league does not agree this was a one sided racial attack. \n\nI live in Northern California, there used to be a football team from the Bay Area with a violent reputation, the team was mostly Black. Several games ended in brawls they started. I went to one game, where safety protocols were in place, fans were told to seperate, the police would only allow one side to leave first, any fight and the game is called. \n\nSure enough, a fight, the mostly Black team was told to leave, they and their fans were escorted out first while the mostly White team and all the fans were ordered to stay until it was safe. Then the police allowed the mostly White team and fans to go to their cars. \n\nYou don't think ABC would cover \"Blacks assault Whites during game and had to be escorted out of town\" do you? \n\nA better question is, WOULD ABC EVER print such language?

These horror stories make the news, and I have seen parents get too carried away—mostly overly invested baseball dads who yelled at and shamed their kids when they didn’t meet Dad’s expectations, but there were only a couple of those. The worst that happened to mine was in a youth basketball game. My ten-year-old went up for the rebound and a bigger kid on the opposing team took a deliberate run at him and slammed him off the court. He literally flew into the wall, which thankfully was covered by a tumbling mat. The coach went and checked him out, and I could see that he was okay, but the opposing team’s coach was banned from the league that day. It had been clear throughout the game that he was encouraging undue roughness and overall dirty play. Everyone on our side was horrified, but there was no parental melee as in this story. If this behavior had been the norm I would have pulled my kid from the league. \n\nHigh school band parents can also get carried away, but they don’t usually scream and throw things, as that would get the entire band suspended from the contest or game.",

But never, ever, do they say, a Black man robbed a White man, a Black man gropped a White woman walking down the street. \nIt's always a \"Man\" robbed someone or a man was caught on video groping a woman. \n\nRace is only relevant to ABC \"journalist\" when they can attack Whites in their story, and notice by the way they will always capitalize every race but WHITE? That too is done to diminish a race of people, to deny their importance compared to all other races, they are NOT EQUAL in the minds of journalist. \n\nSo, there are race claims here and a lot videos were taken of the exchanges and one element is missing from the videos, race. The claims don't seem to be backed up by the videos so far. \n\nHowever, after reviewing the videos and interviews with people, at least one Black coach has been banned from even attending anymore games. Clearly, the league does not agree this was a one sided racial attack. \n\nI live in Northern California, there used to be a football team from the Bay Area with a violent reputation, the team was mostly Black. Several games ended in brawls they started. I went to one game, where safety protocols were in place, fans were told to seperate, the police would only allow one side to leave first, any fight and the game is called. \n\nSure enough, a fight, the mostly Black team was told to leave, they and their fans were escorted out first while the mostly White team and all the fans were ordered to stay until it was safe. Then the police allowed the mostly White team and fans to go to their cars. \n\nYou don't think ABC would cover \"Blacks assault Whites during game and had to be escorted out of town\" do you? \n\nA better question is, WOULD ABC EVER print such language? No, because they have a race baiting agenda that only serves to harm one race, the one they refuse to capitalize.",

My ten-year-old went up for the rebound and a bigger kid on the opposing team took a deliberate run at him and slammed him off the court. He literally flew into the wall, which thankfully was covered by a tumbling mat. The coach went and checked him out, and I could see that he was okay, but the opposing team’s coach was banned from the league that day. It had been clear throughout the game that he was encouraging undue roughness and overall dirty play. Everyone on our side was horrified, but there was no parental melee as in this story.

        "Text": "Climate change is finally at the forefront of global agendas after a year-long delay and myriad promises made since the last major summit.World leaders are converging in Glasgow, Scotland, for COP 26, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, six years after creating the Paris Agreement that potentially set the stage for major action to mitigate global warming.The agreement reached in Paris aimed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, a value, climate scientists calculated, that would be disastrous to exceed. More ambitious efforts aimed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.But as countries continue to review -- and make more ambitious -- the Nationally Determined Contributions submitted in Paris, are they actually doing enough to reach their goals?\"No major emitter is doing enough,\" David Sandalow, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told ABC News. \"Collectively, we are not on track to avoiding dangerous climate change or meeting the Paris Agreement.\"ABC News, climateactiontracker.orgtracking the climate\nprogress for the world’s\nmajor emittersCOP26 is the \"most important conference in the history of the climate crisis,\" Jim Harmon, chairman of the World Resources Institute, told ABC News.MORE: COP26 live updates: World leaders converge upon Glasgow for historic climate summitHere's how some of the world's largest greenhouse gases emitters are faring:China must cut coal useChina is responsible for about 26% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, more than all other developed countries combined, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.In 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared a new aim for the country to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions before 2060 -- the type of \"bold action\" needed for a significant reduction, Harmon said. If implemented, China could generate savings of $530 billion in fuel, operation and maintenance costs over 30 years, Harmon added.But despite the ambitious pledge, China has continued to build coal plants. It's the country's main source of energy. Emissions increase and air quality declines.In 2020, 75% of the world's coal factories were located in China, Maria Mendiluce, CEO of We Mean Business Coalition, a group of seven nonprofits focused on business and policy actions to cut emissions, told ABC News. China built three times more coal power plants in 2020 than the rest of the world combined, according to a report published in August by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. The country plans to build even more, with 43 coal-fired power plants and 18 blast furnaces on the horizon.\"There's an inconsistency between the very ambitious goal of net zero emissions by 2060 and continuing to build coal plants,\" Sandalow said.Getty ImagesA worker rides past a coal fired power plant, in Hanchuan, Hubei province, China, Oct. 13, 2021. China's electricity consumption went up 6.8 percent year on year in September.The country's leaders seem aware how problematic using coal is. In September, Xi pledged to stop building coal-powered plants abroad, and in April he said China would begin to cut coal use in 2026.However, China released few new target goals on Thursday, days ahead of COP26, instead reiterating previous targets.The Climate Action Tracker, a scientific analysis of government measures compared with pledges made in Paris, ranks China's overall efforts as \"highly insufficient.\"It's not impossible for China to meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, Sandalow said. China has led the world in the deployment of wind and solar power, and more than half of the electric vehicles in the world sold in 2020 were in China in 2020, he said, but it's still not enough to offset that China is consuming more coal than the rest of the world combined.\"Today, 2060's a long ways away,\" he said. \"But it's certainly going in the wrong direction to be building those coal plants.\"MORE: This is what individuals can do to slow down climate change, according to expertsUS must turn policy into actionWhile the U.S. may account for just 13% of emissions -- roughly half of China's total -- the country still may be responsible for more total damage, experts told ABC News.Cumulative emissions from the U.S. over the past century are likely twice that of China's, Sandalow said. Some experts argue cumulative emissions far outweigh annual emissions because the major greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. In addition, the emissions per capita in China are less than in the U.S.President Joe Biden campaigned in 2020 with climate change at the forefront of his agenda, after little was done during the Trump administration. Biden has set a target to reduce emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and to hit net-zero emissions by 2050, which Sandalow described as the \"most ambitious climate agenda of any administration in U.S. history.\"The U.S., Japan and Australia have formed an initiative called the Blue Dot Network to provide assessments and new standards to integrate climate and sustainability factors into major projects.The network will involve a \"very credible certification process\" and be finalized later this year, Chris Kline, global senior principal for sustainability of Cardno, a global infrastructure, environmental and social development consultancy, told ABC News.\"That will set standards not only for climate, but also for equity, for human rights, for transparency -- so the whole range of things that we look at from a sustainability perspective,\" he added.Universal Images Group via Getty Images, FILEA large American flag is displayed on the side of an oil refinery at night, south of Los Angeles, June 23, 2017.Beyond everything already been said and done, Congress is going to have to \"step up,\" Kline said, adding that the infrastructure bill, if passed, contains the money and programs necessary to \"make a real difference in helping the U.S. meet its commitments.\"The proposed \"Build Back Better\" plan would include at least $500 billion to tackle climate change -- a range of clean energy tax credits, support for conservation and a methane emissions fee or a tax on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels.Biden also has the authority, under existing statutes, to limit emissions from power plants and automobiles, two of the biggest sources in the U.S., Sandalow said. Appointing John Kerry as the first special presidential envoy for climate also \"sent a strong signal to the world\" about the Biden administration's priorities.\"There's a reasonable prospect that the president's goals can be met, but it would help a lot if Congress enacts the ambitious legislation,\" he added.Still, the overall rating for the U.S. on the Climate Action Tracker is \"insufficient\" because its \"emissions reduction target and provision of climate finance are not enough to make up its fair share.\"India must set ambitious goalsIndia needs a clear path toward systemic climate action, according to the experts.The country accounts of 6% of greenhouse gas emissions, and the impact of the pandemic may have weakened the country's willingness to implement necessary changes, according to Climate Action Tracker, which rates India's overall actions as \"highly insufficient.\"In response to the economic crisis, India unveiled one of the largest stimulus packages in the world -- equal to about 11% of the country's 2019 GDP -- but it included support that likely will lead to using more fossil fuels and using land unsustainably, according to the tracker.India has not submitted pledges ahead of COP26, but, Mendiluce said, there are rumors that in Glasgow the nation's leaders will announce an aim to reduce emissions intensity -- although it's unclear by how much, .Abhishek Chinnappa/Getty ImagesA man walks past photovoltaic cell solar panels in the Pavagada Solar Park, in Kyataganacharulu village, Karnataka, India, Oct. 11, 2021. As the countdown to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) at Glasgow begins, India is in a formidable position to lead climate change conversations as the country is on its way to meet its renewable energy target of 175GW by 2022.But the Indian government has \"very ambitious goals\" for renewable power, Sandalow said. Solar power is \"extremely abundant\" in India, and Narendra Modi touted renewables long before he became prime minister.India's new stimulus package also includes some climate-friendly initiatives, such as $3 billion for battery development and solar power.But the country continues to build coal plants, Sandalow said. It's also approved \"fresh loans\" for a number of thermal power powers, \"undermining a green recovery,\" according to the tracker.MORE: Eating sustainably is one of the easiest ways to combat climate change, experts sayUK must continue drastic reductionsThe host country for COP26 has a \"strong story\" in terms of its progress on climate goals, but continuing that rate of reduction is going to prove difficult, Lord Gregory Barker, former U.K. minister of state for energy and climate change and executive chairman of green energy and metals company En+ Group, told ABC News.The U.K., the first OECD country to adopt a net-zero goal and make it legally binding, has reduced its carbon emissions by more than half since 1990, according to an analysis released in March by Carbon Brief, a website specializing in the science and policy of climate change.The country that popularized the use of coal during the industrial revolution achieved the drastic reduction mostly by switching from to gas to generate electric power, but the milestone also was aided by an 11% decrease in greenhouse gases because of the pandemic.Considering that the U.K. has made little progress in transforming its transportation sector, difficulties remain in zeroing out the remaining emissions, Barker said.\"While we can congratulate the U.K. on progress so far, there is absolutely no room for complacency because the next 50% is going to be a lot harder than the first 50%,\" he added.Matt Cardy/Getty Images, FILEA Clean Air Zone sign along one of the main traffic arteries in the historic city of Bath, March 14, 2021 in Bath, England. The UNESCO World Heritage city became the first outside of London to launch a Clean Air Zone, in which certain highly polluting vehicles will be charged to drive into the city center.Barker envisions \"dramatic innovation\" in the decade ahead, adding that the country will need to \"double down\" on research and development, as the number of solutions in each sector will need to be scaled up.The U.K. accounts for about 1% of global annual emissions. The Climate Action Tracker rates its actions as \"almost sufficient\" but there \"remains a large gap\" between ambitions and actions.Australia needs renewablesAustralia represents only 1% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, but it remains the largest exporter of coal, by far -- a record for which Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been criticized.Climate change has been \"controversial\" in Australia for many years, and the government doesn't consider it a top priority, Sandalow added.In late September, reports that Morrison remained undecided on whether to attend COP26 drew global disdain, but he announced on Oct. 25 he would commit to a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, leaving unchanged the nation's goal for 2030.The country is not even on track to meet its current 2030 target, according to the Climate Action Tracker, which rates Australia's actions as \"highly insufficient.\"Brendon Thorne/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILEBulk carriers are loaded with coal at the Newcastle Coal Terminal in Newcastle, Australia, Oct. 3, 2015.The plan the Australian government has submitted is \"very weak,\" with targets much less ambitious than other industrialized countries, Sandalow said. It relies solely on technology and \"doesn't have the strong policy signals that will be needed to actually reduce emissions.\"\"The government appears intent on replacing fossil fuels with fossil fuels,\" the tracker alleged, citing a 2021-22 budget that allocates large sums to gas infrastructure projects and a gas-fired power station with no new support for renewables or electric vehicles. Australia also plans to replace a coal plant with a federally funded gas plant in New South Wales, while continuing to support carbon capture and storage, and fossil fuel-derived hydrogen.Collective hope, private investmentIt won't be one country's actions that save the planet, experts agreed. It simply can't be.Working collectively has come to be embraced by \"more and more people\" since the Paris Agreement, Kline said.It'll be incumbent on G-20 countries, which are responsible for the vast majority of emissions, to do the most work to limit continued warming, Harmon said, but the U.S. may put pressure on countries with  weaker pledges -- Mexico, Brazil and Australia among them.\"Unless China starts cutting its emissions, unless the United States starts cutting emissions, unless the whole world starts cutting into missions, we're not going to solve the global warming problem,\" Sandalow said.Jane Barlow/PA Images via Getty ImagesArtist Greg Mitchell completes his climate-crisis themed mural that depicts the Earth on fire and reads \"While you were talking,\" on the side of St. John's Church in Edinburgh, Scotland, Oct. 25, 2021, to coincide with the Cop26 in Glasgow.Kline said the key to achieving commitments by governments will require a shift in global private investment.\"So,\" he added, \"you've got the private investors, you've got multinational government agencies and these international professional organizations all kind of coming together, and developing some really important tools and processes that help get beyond the aspirational statements.\"Barker said the \"big six\" industrial sectors -- energy, transportation, agriculture, forest and land use, industry and buildings and cities -- will need to implement decarbonization on their own, regardless of what governments target.\"There's a recognition now,\" he added, \"that the private sector really has a critical role to play, to actually deliver on the pledges that the governments are making.\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "GLASGOW, Scotland -- President Joe Biden was swinging the focus of his battle for fast, concerted action against         global warming from the U.S. Congress to the world on Monday, scolding rival China on climate and appealing to other leaders at a U.N. summit to commit to the kind of big climate measures that he is still working to nail down at home.Speaking to world leaders at the newly opened climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, Biden planned to tote up his not-yet year-old administration's climate efforts and announce new climate initiatives, including billions of dollars in hoped-for legislation to help poorer communities abroad deal with climate damage already underway.Wading back into hands-on diplomacy with allies overseas this week after         the withdrawal of the Trump administration, Biden on the eve of his climate summit arrival touted “the power of America showing up.\" Air Force One touched down Monday morning in grey Glasgow for the summit, on the heels of separate Group of 20 talks in Rome over the weekend.The Glasgow summit is often billed as essential to putting         the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord into action.But Biden and his administration face obstacles in prodding the United States and other nations to act fast enough on climate, abroad as at home. In the runup to the summit, the administration has tried hard to temper expectations that two weeks of talks involving more than 100 world leaders will produce major breakthroughs on cutting climate-damaging emissions.Rather than a quick fix, “Glasgow is the beginning of this decade race, if you will,” Biden's climate envoy,         John Kerry, told reporters Sunday.As the summit opens, the United States is still struggling to get some of the world's biggest climate polluters — China, Russia and India — to join the U.S. and its allies in stronger pledges to burn far less coal, gas and oil and to move to cleaner energy.Kerry on Sunday defended the outcome of         a summit of the Group of 20 leading economies that ended earlier that day in Rome. The G-20 meeting was supposed to create momentum for more climate progress in Glasgow, and leaders at the Italy summit did agree on a series of measures, including formalizing a pledge to cut off international subsidies for dirty-burning, coal-fired power plants.Biden also lauded a separate         U.S.-European Union steel agreement announced Sunday as a chance to curb imports of “dirty” Chinese steel forged by coal power. It's another step toward potentially using Western markets as leverage to persuade China, the world's top climate polluter, to ease up in its enthusiasm for coal power.But G-20 leaders offered more vague pledges than commitments of firm action, saying they would seek carbon neutrality “by or around mid-century.”Major polluters including China and Russia have made clear they had no immediate intention of following the U.S. and its European and Asian allies to zero out all fossil fuel pollution by 2050. Scientists say massive, fast cuts in fossil fuel pollution are essential to having any hope of keeping global warming at or below the limits set in the Paris climate accord.The world currently is on track for a level of warming that would melt much of the planet’s ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, experts say.Biden told reporters Sunday night he personally found the outcome of the Rome summit “disappointing,” countering the positive assessments of his aides. And he put the blame on two rivals of the U.S.“The disappointment relates to the fact that Russia, and ... not only Russia but China basically didn’t show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate changes,\" Biden said.The Biden administration on Monday released its strategy for turning talk into reality in transforming the U.S. into an entirely clean energy nation by 2050. The long-term plan, filed in compliance with the Paris agreement, lays out a United States increasingly running on wind, solar and other clean energy, Americans zipping around in electric vehicles and on mass transit, state-of-the-art technology and wide open spaces carefully preserved to soak up carbon dioxide from the air.The Biden administration has succeeded, over 10 months of diplomacy leading up to the Glasgow summit, in helping win significant new climate pledges from allies. That includes persuading many foreign governments to set more ambitious targets for emissions cuts, promoting a global pledge to cut emissions of a potent climate harm, methane, and the promise from leading economies to end funding for coal energy abroad.European leaders make clear they are happy to see Biden and the U.S. back in the climate effort after his predecessor, Donald Trump,         turned his back on the Paris accord and on allies in general. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen smiled at Biden throughout the announcement on Sunday's steel deal, calling him “dear Joe.”Neither Russian President Vladimir Putin nor Chinese President Xi Jinping is attending the Glasgow summit, although they are sending senior officials. Their refusals, and India’s, to move substantially faster to cut their reliance on coal and petroleum threaten to frustrate hopes of reaching the target cuts set in the Paris climate accord.China under Xi has firmed up commitments to cut emissions but at a slower pace than the U.S. has encouraged.Traveling with Biden, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with the president that climate change should not viewed as a rivalry between the U.S. and China, as China, the world’s second largest economy, could act on its own.“They are a big country with a lot of resources and a lot of capabilities, and they are perfectly well capable of living up to their responsibilities,” Sullivan said. “Nothing about the nature of the relationship between the U.S. and China, structurally or otherwise, impedes or stands in the way of them doing their part.”Biden comes to the international climate summit with the fate of         his own climate package still uncertain in Congress. Objections from holdouts within Biden's own Democratic Party have compelled him to back away from one bill that would have prodded the United States' own move away from coal and natural gas and to cleaner energy for generating electricity.Hundreds of billions of dollars of climate measures remain in Biden's package before Congress, however.“The largest investment in the history of the world” on climate, Biden told reporters Sunday. “And it's gonna pass.”While an opening ceremony in Glasgow on Sunday formally kicked off the climate talks, the more anticipated launch comes Monday, when Biden and other leaders gather to lay out their countries’ efforts to curb emissions and deal with the mounting damage from climate change.Biden will also participate in a climate event on “action and solidarity” Monday and meet on the sidelines of the summit with Indonesian President Joko Widodo.———Miller reported from Rome.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- The chief executive of British bank Barclays stepped down Monday following a report by United Kingdom regulators into his past links with the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Jes Staley has previously said he “deeply regrets” his relationship with Epstein, who killed himself at a federal jail in New York in August 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial. There is no suggestion that the 64-year-old Staley knew anything about Epstein's alleged crimes.Staley said he will contest regulators' preliminary conclusions, which were shared with him and the bank Friday. The report by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority examined the way Staley characterized his relationship with Epstein to Barclays when he was Epstein’s private banker in his previous job at U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan.In a statement Monday, Barclays noted that the investigation “makes no findings” that Staley saw or knew about any of Epstein’s alleged crimes, which it said was \"the central question” behind its decision to back its chief executive following Epstein's arrest in summer 2019.Staley said his last contact with Epstein was in fall 2015, when he and his wife sailed to Epstein’s private island for lunch. That trip occurred shortly before he joined Barclays. He said he had no contact with Epstein once he joined the bank in December 2015.C.S. Venkatakrishnan, head of global markets for the bank, will take over as chief executive. Barclays said succession planning has been in place for some time, and he had been identified as the preferred candidate more than a year ago.Shares in Barclays fell 2% following the announcement, as Staley had been widely credited with doing a good job at the bank.\"Barclays is right to pull the plug now,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. “It probably could have done it earlier.”The bank said Staley will get a 2.5 million pound ($3.5 million) payout and receive other benefits for a year. He also may be eligible to receive repatriation costs to the U.S. and could receive more cash.",

The workers denied the accusations, the prosecutor’s statement said.The sickened tourists include 14 Estonians, 29 Russians and four from the Czech Republic. They were hospitalized after they had dinner over the weekend in the resort city of Hurghada, the statement said. Many have been discharged from hospital after their conditions improved, it said.Tourism authorities have ordered the closure of the hotel, suspended its director and revoked his work license.Russia’s TASS news agency quoted the Russian Consul General in Hurghada, Viktor Voropayev, as saying that the tourists have been accommodated at other hotels. Russia is a major source of foreign tourists visiting Egypt.“The health condition of all the patients is satisfactory, stable and not life-threatening,” Voropayev was quoted as saying.The incident has come as Egypt is struggling to revive its vital tourism industry, which was badly hit by the turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising, and more recently by the coronavirus pandemic.The government has kept looser virus-related restrictions in the Red Sea resorts of Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh to try to attract foreign visitors.Government efforts received a boost in August when Russia allowed the resumption of flights between its territory and the Red Sea resorts for the first time since a bomb by the local Islamic State affiliate brought down a Russian flight over Sinai Peninsula in October 2015, killing all 224 people on board.",

Former Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai pleaded guilty to taking part in the unauthorized vigil, while Lee also pleaded guilty to organizing it. They will enter mitigation pleas Nov. 12 before they are sentenced.Lai, the founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, pleaded not guilty to inciting others to take part in the unauthorized assembly. Two other defendants, lawyer Chow Hang-tung and former reporter Gwyneth Ho, pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.Police last year banned the annual vigil for the first time in three decades, citing public health risks from the coronavirus pandemic. Critics believe the ban is part of the crackdown on opposition in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory following months of anti-government protests in 2019.More than a dozen activists turned up at the June 4 vigil last year despite the ban, and thousands followed suit, breaking through barriers in spite of police warnings. They set up around Victoria Park to light candles and sing songs.Police later arrested and charged 26 activists over the vigil, including members of the Hong Kong Alliance that organizes the annual vigil.The Hong Kong Alliance disbanded in September, amid accusations from the government that the organization was working for foreign interests. Leaders of the alliance categorically denied the accusations.Of the 26 activists arrested, 16 of them including prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong have pleaded guilty and were handed jail sentences ranging between four to 10 months. Three were given suspended sentences.Two other activists in the case, Nathan Law and Sunny Cheung, have fled the city.",

        "Text": "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippines forces have killed a key rebel commander in one of Asia's longest-running insurgencies, in what the military described as a daring raid in the country's remote southern region, but what guerrilla leaders claimed was an ambush.Jorge Madlos, who used the nom de guerre Ka Oris, was for many decades a leading figure and spokesman for the communist fighters in the southern Philippines's mountainous hinterlands.Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Monday said government forces killed Madlos in the Bukidnon province on Saturday. He described the rebel's death as a major blow to the already-battered New People’s Army guerrilla group.Regional military commander Maj. Gen. Romeo Brawner said villagers tipped off the military about the presence of about 30 rebels, who were holding discussions with residents in a far-flung village near Impasug-ong town. Fighter planes were deployed to fire rockets on the rebel positions, which the military said was protected by land mines, before a ground assault was ordered.After a gunbattle that raged for less than an hour, troops found the bodies of the 72-year-old Madlos and his medical aide, their assault rifles and ammunition, Brawner said.“Justice has been served for those innocent civilians and their communities he terrorized for several decades,” Brawner told reporters.The guerrillas, however, said in a statement posted on a website linked with the group that the long-ailing Madlos was traveling with a rebel medic on a motorcycle to get medical treatment when government forces gunned them down. The rebels said both Madlos and his companion were unarmed and added that no military airstrike or gunbattle took place.Military commanders have blamed Madlos and his forces for years of deadly assaults against security forces, as well as attacks on mining companies, pineapple and other agricultural plantations to extort money, or what the guerrillas call “revolutionary taxes,” from local and foreign-owned businesses.Madlos was blamed by the military for helping to plot a 2011 attack by more than 200 guerrillas on three nickel mining complexes in southern Surigao del Norte province where the rebels ransacked the site after disarming guards and holding several employees at gunpoint. One of the companies that came under attack, the country’s biggest nickel producer partly owned by Japan’s Sumitomo Corp., was forced to temporarily halt operations following the raid.Madlos was a student activist, who quit university and went underground after then-Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972. Distinguished by his trademark Mao-style cap, goatee and folksy manners, Madlos stuck it out with the insurgency even after falling ill more than a decade ago. In an interview with The Associated Press in 2010 from a rebel mountain camp in the south, he said that only one thing could make him leave his comrades.“Our retirement comes in death,” Madlos said then.The military says there remains about 3,500 to 4,000 communist fighters despite years of rebel setbacks, surrenders and factionalism. Peace talks brokered by Norway collapsed between President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration and the guerrillas after both sides accused each other of renewed deadly attacks.",

        "Text": "SANAA, Yemen -- At least 10 civilians were killed and 25 wounded when two ballistic missiles from Yemen’s Houthi rebels stuck a religious educational facility in the central province of Marib, officials said Monday.The missiles hit Dar al-Hadith - a religious school and a mosque - in the residential neighborhood of al-Aumd late Sunday and the casualties included women and children, they said.The attack also damaged nearby houses, said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.There was no immediate comment from the Iranian-backed Houthis, who have attempted for months to take oil-rich Marib to complete their control over the northern half of Yemen.Yemen has been engulfed in a civil war since 2014, when the Houthis captured the capital, Sanaa, and forced President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi and his internationally recognized government to flee to the south, and then later to Saudi Arabia.A Saudi-led coalition entered the war the next year to try restore the government to power. The war has deteriorated largely into a stalemate and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.The facility includes a religious school and a mosque attended by about 1,200 Muslim students from across the country. Most of the students and teachers left the area last month as the Houthis made progress in their offensive on Marib.Moammar al-Iryani, information minister of the internationally recognized government, said the casualties included women and children.“This horrific massacre comes after a series of systematic killings of civilians that the terrorist Houthi militia committed in the past few days” in the government-held cities of Marib and Taiz, he said.He called on the U.N. Security Council and the United States to pressure the Houthis to stop their attacks on civilians and to prosecute those implicated as “war criminals.”A Houthi ballistic missile struck the house of a key tribal leader in al-Aumd on Thursday, killing at least 11 civilians and wounding 16 others.On Saturday, the Houthis shelled the residential Camp neighborhood on the outskirts of the government-held city of Taiz, killing at least three children from the same family. At least six other children were wounded, according to al-Iryani.Meanwhile in Tazi, government forces and allied tribal fighters launched an offensive late Sunday on the last remining pocket held by the Houthis on the city’s the south western outskirts.The government-run SABA news agency reported Monday that at least seven Houthi fighters were killed including a field commander, and six others were wounded.",

        "Text": "BEIJING -- China’s manufacturing activity contracted for a second straight month in October amid materials shortages and a widespread power crunch.China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers index dipped to 49.2 in October, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, down from 49.6 in September. The index is measured on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity increasing.The indicators are closely watched as a barometer of China’s economy. Analysts have warned activity may slow further as manufacturers grapple with the power crunch, shortages of materials and surging costs.In a statement Sunday, National Bureau of Statistics economist Zhao Qinghe said that the drop in factory activity was due to tightened power supplies, higher costs for materials and slowing supply and demand.Since September, local governments have been doubling down on meeting energy consumption targets set by Beijing to ensure China’s carbon emissions peak by 2030. Factories and companies were ordered to reduce or even halt production temporarily.Industries like textiles, iron smelting and non-metallic mineral products were among the hardest hit, Zhao said.At the same time, many manufacturers face bottlenecks in getting supplies and in getting their products to customers.The monthly purchasing managers’ index by Caixin, a Chinese business magazine, suggested that manufacturing activity grew in October compared to the previous month as demand recovered.Caixin’s monthly purchasing managers’ index rose to 50.6 in October, up from 50 September. The Caixin index tends to focus on smaller, export-oriented firms, while the official PMI by the National Bureau of Statistics focuses more on large enterprises.Official data also showed that service sector activity slowed down in October, falling to 52.4 from 53.2 last month. The services sector has been slower to rebound due to the pandemic, and is currently affected by a number of COVID-19 outbreaks in northern China.The composite PMI, which captures activity from both the manufacturing and services, declined to 50.8 from last month’s 51.7.",

Before the pandemic, the Christmas season saw hundreds of thousands of people visit Bethlehem, believed to be birthplace of Jesus, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Israel had planned to reopen to tourists last spring but delayed the move amid a spike in cases driven by the highly contagious delta variant. Israel has since rolled out a booster campaign in which nearly half the population has received a third vaccine dose, driving cases back down.Travelers must show proof of vaccination, a booster shot, or recovery from coronavirus within the last six months. Authorities recognize most vaccines, but those vaccinated with Russia’s Sputnik must undergo a serological test upon arrival. Travelers must also present a negative coronavirus test before boarding their flights and take another one upon arrival.Throughout the pandemic, Israel has allowed some foreigners to visit, including people with close relatives in the country and people coming for work or study. It began allowing organized tour groups in September.",

People will be required to isolate at home unless they are buying groceries or medicine, getting medical help, or accessing banking services.News of the case has prompted hundreds of Tongans to line up at vaccination sites around the country. About 31% of Tongans are fully vaccinated and 48% have had at least one dose, according to research group Our World in Data.The infected traveler was among 215 passengers who arrived on a flight from Christchurch on Wednesday.Christchurch had been free from the virus for months until last week, when several community cases were reported.New Zealand health officials said the traveler to Tonga was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine and had returned a negative test before leaving for Tonga.Tonga is among the few remaining nations in the world that have avoided outbreaks of the virus due to its isolation.The nearby nation of Fiji avoided significant outbreaks until April, when the delta variant ripped through the island chain, infecting more than 50,000 people and killing at least 673.Tonga's frontline workers — including health staff, police officers and airport staff — who were on duty when the plane arrived had also been put into quarantine.Located northeast of New Zealand, Tonga is home to about 106,000 people.",

        "Text": "TOKYO -- Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says Japan should revitalize its economy through “new capitalism.\" Many in this avidly capitalist country are puzzled over exactly what he has in mind.Kishida has said he believes a more equal distribution of wealth is needed to prevent the world’s third largest economy from sinking into stagnation. That sounds dramatic, but analysts say he doesn’t stand for drastic change.The conservative, pro-U.S. and pro-business Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan almost continuously since World War II, won a better-than-expected 261 seats Sunday in the lower house of Parliament, comfortably exceeding the 233 seats needed and giving Kishida a mandate, at least for now.“With this definite support from the people, I will dedicate myself to working on policies and parliamentary efforts,” said Kishida, chosen as head of the governing party just a month earlier.The Liberal Democrats prevailed over weaker opposition parties despite widespread unhappiness, until a recent drop in cases, with the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, perennial corruption scandals and a failure to deliver on promises for sweeping reforms intended to drive much faster growth.Kishida appears unlikely to stray far from the pro-market policies of the past decade. Under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who stayed in office from late 2012-mid-2020, the economy limped along with massive help from the central bank's ultra-cheap credit and government spending. Abe's successor, Yoshihide Suga, stuck with that “Abenomics\" program.Now, Japanese are waiting to see what “Kishidanomics\" will bring.“Kishidanomics remains a complete mystery to me,” said Kinuko Kuwabara, a free-lancer in Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan.What people really want tackled are coronavirus pandemic measures and corruption in high places, she said.“Maybe Kishida himself isn’t sure what he plans to do,” said Hideo Kumano, executive chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute.“All we have are slogans. It’s unclear how much you can really believe them and how they can be realized.”Topping Kishida’s to-do list is another big dose of government spending to help Japan recover from the COVID-19 shock. The economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.9% in the April-June quarter, a tepid pace considering the severity of the pandemic downturn in 2020.When taking office, Kishida said he believed raising the tax on capital gains would help to rebalance an economy that is growing increasingly unequal. Although the disparity of wealth is greater statistically in the U.S. than in Japan, Americans have access to more generous social welfare programs, according to OECD data. That means poverty is a growing problem in Japan, especially among single mothers struggling to make a living wage.Kishida backtracked from talk of raising taxes after a few days of stock market sell-offs, saying a higher capital gains tax — which would help redress Japan's highly regressive tax regime — would have to wait until the economy was growing at a much stronger pace.He now says he hopes to drive growth by slashing corporate taxes — which Abe also did — in the classic “trickle down\" strategy of encouraging companies to raise wages.That approach has fallen flat, however, as companies hoarded their earnings. Instead, a growing share of workers are employed part-time or on contracts that don't provide full benefits. The tax system, meanwhile, penalizes families with two full-time incomes.In the era of rapid growth that followed World War II, workers were promised jobs for life. With “lifetime employment” a vanishing dream, people need to freely job-hop and find new opportunities and skills.Economists say that apart from boosting wages to encourage consumer spending, what Japan really needs for sustainable growth is deregulation and a freer labor market. That's daunting and politically risky because such changes require reforms that would shake up vested interests, angering the constituencies, such as farmers and big businesses, that have helped keep the Liberal Democrats in power for so long.The current system protects and rewards old-guard under-performing companies while failing to drive innovation.None of this was headline news in the run-up to Sunday’s election, when opposition parties campaigned on promises of cash handouts and lowering taxes. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, promised more spending in coronavirus research, carbon neutrality, hydrogen energy and efforts to restart nuclear plants — not better social safety nets and redistributing wealth.“We don’t know for sure what he plans to do, but we know his approach will not be that different from ‘Abenomics,’ ” said Hideaki Tanaka, a professor of public policy at Meiji University in Tokyo.“What we have is a to-do list. Without a real analysis of why Japan isn’t growing and lacks innovation, and a real diagnosis of what’s behind this sickness, there can be no cure,” he said.———Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",

        "Text": "MEXICO CITY -- A series of explosions, apparently caused by an illegal tap on a natural gas line, rocked the central Mexico city of Puebla before dawn Sunday, killing at least one person, injuring 11 and damaging dozens of homes, authorities said.Puebla state Gov. Miguel Barbosa said an emergency call warning of a gas smell and cloud in the area gave officials about 80 minutes to evacuate some 2,000 people living as far as a kilometer (about s half mile) from the leak before the first of three explosions, which came shortly before 3 a.m.“If there had not been an evacuation and there had not been coordination, there would have been a tragedy of great proportions,\" the governor said.Officials said at least 54 homes were destroyed or damaged in the San Pablo Xochimehuacan district of Puebla, a city of 1.7 million people. At least two of the injured were in critical condition with severe burns.“When I heard the chaos, the screaming of the people, that’s when we realized that the smoke from the gas was coming ... and we didn’t have time to take out documents or animals or anything,” one resident told The Associated Press shortly after being told his home was completely destroyed.Fires burned in the rubble into the evening, when a heavy rain finally doused the flames. Shortly before 7 p.m., authorities announced that workers from Mexico's state oil company had succeeded in closing off the leaking gas.Officials briefly evacuated 37 patients from a nearby hospital, but it was back in service hours later after suffering only minor damage, such as broken windows.The governor said rescue teams with dogs were searching for more possible victims, though there were no reports of missing people.Javier González of the government's Petroleos Mexicanos company said the tap apparently was installed on a property where officials found a tanker truck and 25 gas cylinders. Across the street is a gas distribution company.Officials said 1,400 soldiers, National Guard troops, police, firefighters and rescue personnel were working in the area following the explosions. An additional 870 soldiers were on their way from the Valley of Mexico with tools, machinery and excavators and four search dogs, officials said.The governor vowed to “get to the bottom” of who was responsible for the explosion.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador offered condolences to victims of the blast. Early in his administration, he crusaded against thieves who tap into gas and gasoline lines — even shutting down major fuel ducts to get rid of thieves.But official reports indicate that as recently as March, Mexico was losing an average of 4,000 barrels a day of gasoline and diesel to to such taps, which are sometimes guarded by local communities who see them as a resource.An illegal tap of a gasoline line caused an explosion that killed at least 134 people in the town of Tlahuelilpan, north of Mexico City, in 2019. Townspeople had gathered in a field to fill containers with gasoline leaking from the line.",

        "Text": "TOKYO -- A man dressed in a Joker costume and brandishing a knife stabbed at least one passenger on a Tokyo commuter train before starting a fire, injuring passengers and sending people scrambling to escape and jumping from windows, police and witnesses said.The Tokyo Fire Department said 17 passengers were injured, including three seriously. Not all of them were stabbed and most of the other injuries were not serious, the fire department said.The attacker, whom police identified as 24-year-old Kyota Hattori, was arrested on the spot after Sunday's attack and was being investigated on suspicion of attempted murder, the Tokyo metropolitan police department said Monday.The attacker, riding an express train headed to Tokyo's Shinjuku station, abruptly took out a knife and stabbed a seated passenger — a man in his 70s — in the right chest, police said. Injury details of other 16 passengers are still being investigated, police said.Police said he told authorities that he wanted to kill people and get the death penalty. Nippon Television said he also said that he used an earlier train stabbing case as an example.Witnesses told police that the attacker was wearing a bright outfit — a green shirt, a blue suit and a purple coat — like the Joker villain in Batman comics or someone going to a Halloween event, according to media reports.A video posted by a witness on social media showed the suspect seated, with his leg crossed and smoking in one of the train cars, presumably after the attack.Tokyo police officials said the attack happened inside the Keio train near the Kokuryo station.Television footage showed a number of firefighters, police officials and paramedics rescuing the passengers, many of whom escaped through train windows. In one video, passengers were running from another car that was in flames.NHK said the suspect, after stabbing passengers, poured a liquid resembling oil from a plastic bottle and set fire, which partially burned seats.Shunsuke Kimura, who filmed the video, told NHK that he saw passengers desperately running and while he was trying to figure out what happened, he heard an explosive noise and saw smoke wafting. He also jumped from a window but fell on the platform and hurt his shoulder.“Train doors were closed and we had no idea what was happening, and we jumped from the windows,” Kimura said. “It was horrifying.”The attack was the second involving a knife on a Tokyo train in three months.In August, the day before the Tokyo Olympics closing ceremony, a 36-year-old man stabbed 10 passengers on a commuter train in Tokyo in a random burst of violence. The suspect later told police that he wanted to attack women who looked happy.While shooting deaths are rare in Japan, the country has had a series of high-profile knife killings in recent years.In 2019, a man carrying two knives attacked a group of schoolgirls waiting at a bus stop just outside Tokyo, killing two people and injuring 17 before killing himself. In 2018, a man killed a passenger and injuring two others in a knife attack on a bullet train. In 2016, a former employee at a home for the disabled killed 19 people and injured more than 20.",

        "Text": "BEIJING -- China’s economic rebound from the coronavirus pandemic is stalling as President Xi Jinping’s government cracks down on surging corporate debt.For a decade, the ruling Communist Party has talked about shifting to economy based on spending by 1.4 billion consumers instead of on building factories and apartments. But with each slowdown, Beijing fell back on pepping up growth with more construction and borrowing.Finally, Xi’s government is confronting the problem by clamping down on borrowing by a real estate industry that supports millions of jobs.That is sending shockwaves through the economy. Businesses and households are jittery as housing sales and construction slump. That is chilling auto and retail sales. It has possible global repercussions as China buys less steel and other building materials.“Many customers would like to wait and see,” said Liang Qiming, a salesman for online real estate broker 5i5j.com in Nanchang, a southern provincial capital that was turned into a boomtown by a flurry of construction over the past two decades.China became the world’s factory, but the bigger power driving its economic boom was a construction frenzy that took off in the late 1990s. Developers and local governments poured borrowed money into blanketing the country with new apartments, office towers, shopping malls, bridges and railways.Xi’s government appears to be willing to accept a politically painful slowdown to get that debt under control and achieve the longer-term goal of self-sustaining, safer growth.Beijing “doesn’t want growth at all costs, followed by the likely or inevitable financial market crash, which is very much the sort of European-U.S. model,” said Robert Carnell, head of Asia research for ING.Financial markets are on edge about whether one of the biggest developers, Evergrande Group, might be allowed to collapse under 2 trillion yuan ($310 billion) in debt as a warning to others.Beijing wants to make sure families receive apartments sold to them by Evergrande before they were built, as is common in China, economists say. But they say it is trying to avoid sending the wrong message by bailing out the company.Evergrande is a “pre-emptive cleanup,” Carnell said.China revived from the coronavirus pandemic earlier than the United States, Europe or Japan, but but that rebound quickly flattened out.Depressed by the building slump, the economy expanded just 4.9% over a year earlier in the three months ending in September much weaker than the previous quarter’s 7.9% growth. Compared with the previous quarter — the way other major economies are measured — growth in the three months ending in September fell to 0.2%, among the weakest of the past decade.Housing sales fell 32% in September from a year earlier. Buyers were put off by curbs on mortgage lending and anxiety about whether developers might fail to deliver apartments paid for in advance. That means less spending on furniture and appliances.With no sign Beijing will ease up, forecasters expect the economy to weaken further, since consumers who are reluctant to spend won't fill the gap left by lower investment.This quarter's growth might fall as low as 3% over a year ago, according to Nomura. Bank of America cut its full-year forecast from 8% to 7.7%, which still would be among the world’s strongest. It slashed next year’s outlook from 5.3% to just 4%.The total owed by companies, households and the government rose to almost the equivalent of three times annual economic output last year from 270% in 2018 — high for a middle-income country.Xi affirmed his priorities at an August planning meeting, calling for “high-quality development” and “forestalling major financial risks,” according to the official Xinhua News Agency.“China is in the middle of a transformation from growth driven by blind investments to high-quality growth,” said Zuo Xiaolei, an economist in Beijing.Regulators tightened control over use of debt by real estate developers last year. Hundreds already had gone bankrupt following other restrictions imposed since 2017.Tightening control, Beijing on Oct. 15 declared 19 of China's biggest banks that account for three-quarters of their industry's assets to be “domestic systemically important banks\" that will face closer government scrutiny and lending controls.A midsize developer, Modern Land (China) Co., announced it failed to pay off on a $250 million bond due Oct. 25. Earlier, another developer, Fantasia Holdings Group, missed a $205.7 million payment to bondholders due Oct 5.Evergrande has caused more anxiety due to its vast debt, which includes $18 billion owed to foreign bondholders.It failed to make a bond payment due Sept. 23. An official newspaper said the company avoided being declared in default by wiring $83.5 million for the payment on Oct. 22, one day before the end of a 30-day grace period.“The risk of a sharper slowdown in real estate activity can’t be ruled out,” Tommy Wu of Oxford Economics said in a report.Meanwhile, the economy also faces headwinds from power rationing imposed in major manufacturing areas to meet official efficiency goals. Automakers and other factories have been disrupted by shortages of processor chips.Auto sales plunged 16.5% in September from a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Buyers are uneasy about the pandemic and economic outlook, said Chu Xianwu, who sells Jeeps at Shandong Xinju Auto trading Co. in the eastern city of Jinan. He said sales there were down 20% from six months ago.“I really hope the situation will improve in the near future,” Chu said.———AP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed.",

        "Text": "TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s coalition kept a comfortable majority in Sunday's parliamentary election despite losing some seats as his weeks-old government grapples with a coronavirus-battered economy and regional security challenges.Kishida’s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito together won 293 seats, according to final but not yet official results. That's well above the majority of 233 in the 465-member lower house, the more powerful of Japan’s two-chamber Diet, where they previously had 305 seats.The LDP lost 15 seats from its pre-election share, but the 261 seats it won are “an absolute majority” — a level that allows the party and its ruling bloc to control all parliamentary committees and easily ram through legislation.The LDP's losses in single constituencies included those held by influential party members, such as secretary general Akira Amari, who was stung by a past bribery scandal. Amari offered to resign even though he eventually secured his seat in proportional representation.“The lower house election is about choosing a leadership,\" Kishida said late Sunday after his ruling coalition secured the majority. \"I believe we received a mandate from the voters.”Kishida said the results were in part due to opposition parties' strategy of fielding unified candidates in many single-seat electoral districts, but also because of voters' judgment of his predecessors over the past four years.Kishida, 64, dissolved the lower house only 10 days after taking office on Oct. 4. He had won the leadership race in his ruling party because the party's conservative leaders saw him as a safe status-quo successor to Yoshihide Suga and his influential predecessor Shinzo Abe.Five opposition parties together lost 10 seats as their strategy of unifying candidates in most single-seat constituencies backfired, apparently because the Japanese Community Party was included in their united front. The largest opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan lost 13 seats to 96, and the communists lost two seats, retreating to 12.A big winner was the rightwing Ishin, or the Japan Innovation Party, which nearly quadrupled its seats to 41, rising to the third biggest party. Despite the party's previous stance close to the LDP, its growing criticism of both the ruling and opposition blocs catered to voters who wanted a change from the LDP but found the opposition bloc uncomfortable, experts say.Kishida’s immediate task has been to rally support for a party weakened by Suga’s perceived high-handed approach to pandemic measures and his insistence on holding the Tokyo Olympics despite widespread opposition because of a high number of coronavirus cases, which have since dropped sharply.Kishida repeatedly stressed his determination to listen to the people and to address criticism that the nine years led by Suga and Shinzo Abe had fanned corruption, tamed bureaucrats and muzzled opposing opinions.The campaign has largely centered on COVID-19 response measures and revitalizing the economy.While the ruling party stressed the importance of having a stronger military amid worries over China’s growing influence and North Korea’s missile and nuclear threat, opposition parties focused on diversity issues and pushed for gender equality.Opposition leaders complain that recent LDP governments have widened the gap between rich and poor, did not support the economy during the pandemic and stalled gender equality and diversity initiatives. Japan this year ranked 120th in the World Economic Forum's 156-nation gender-gap ranking.The opposition has long struggled to win enough votes to form a government after a brief rule of the now-defunct center-left Democratic Party of Japan in 2009-2012, as they have not been able to present a grand vision for the country.On the economy, Kishida has emphasized growth by raising income, while opposition groups focus more on redistribution of wealth and call for cash payouts to pandemic-hit low-income households.Kishida, during the campaign, promised to spur growth and “distribute its fruit” to the people as income.Kishida said late Sunday he planned to reappoint the same members to his post-election Cabinet to speed up the work on a supplementary budget by the end of this year so that he can fund an economic package to provide support for the people and businesses hit by the pandemic.“I will take concrete steps to achieve our policies as soon as possible,” Kishida said. “I need to move quickly.”Before working on those, Kishida said he was heading to Glasgow to attend the COP26 summit on Tuesday. “It's a global issue for all mankind, and Japan has to take our responsibility,” he said.The LDP opposes legislation guaranteeing equality for sexual minorities and allowing separate surnames for married couples.Of the 1,051 candidates, only 17% were women, despite a 2018 law promoting gender equality in elections, which is toothless because there is no penalty. Women account for about 10% of parliament, a situation gender rights experts call “democracy without women.”Some voters had little hope of change by the Kishida's government.Shinji Asada, 44, said he compared COVID-19 measures to pick a candidate, hoping for a change of leadership, as he thought the ruling party lacked explanation and transparency over its pandemic measures. He said that despite Kishida’s promise to be more mindful of the people’s voices, “I thought nothing would change (under him) after seeing his Cabinet,” whose posts largely went to party factions that voted for him.———Associated Press journalist Chisato Tanaka contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "ROME -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi as part of the Group of 20 summit on Sunday — an outreach designed to ensure that the intensely competitive relationship between the world's two largest economies doesn't veer into open conflicts.Senior State Department officials described the conversations as candid, constructive and productive, saying that Blinken was clear about U.S. concerns during the roughly hourlong meeting. The officials insisted on anonymity to discuss the exchanges.One of the U.S. goals is to maintain an open line of communication with China and set a virtual meeting later this year between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping.A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said that Wang, while blaming the U.S. for a sharp deterioration in relations, said he would like to establish regular contact with Blinken to exchange views on how to manage the differences between their two countries, avoid misjudgments and explore cooperation.Blinken said at the meeting that China has increased tensions with regard to Taiwan and that America wants to continue its “one-China policy,” which recognizes Beijing but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. During China's National Day weekend in early October, China dispatched 149 military aircraft southwest of Taiwan in strike group formations, causing Taiwan to scramble aircraft and activate its air defense missile systems. Biden alarmed China shortly after by saying that the U.S. has a firm commitment to help Taiwan defend itself in the event of a Chinese attack.Asked in a CNN town hall whether the U.S. would come to Taiwan’s defense, Biden said, “Yes, we have a commitment to do that.” U.S. officials immediately moved to clarify that there had been no change to U.S. posture toward Taiwan.Blinken told CNN on Sunday that there is “no change” in the U.S.' longstanding commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act “to make sure that Taiwan has the means to defend itself. And we stand by that.” He said Biden's commitment dated back to his time as a U.S. senator.Wang blamed the current Taiwan leadership for the uptick in tensions, as well as U.S. support for what he called “Taiwan independence forces,” the Chinese statement said. He called on the U.S. to pursue a real one-China policy instead of a fake one, accusing the American side of saying one thing and doing another.China and Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. The U.S. cut formal diplomatic relations with Taipei in 1979 in order to recognize Beijing. The U.S. does not openly contest China’s claim to Taiwan, but is committed by law to ensure the island can defend itself and to treat all threats toward it as matters of grave concern.Blinken noted that the G-20 summit is being followed by the United Nations climate summit in Scotland, saying that the U.S. expects China to curbs its greenhouse gas emissions as a responsible global power for the good of the world.Trade issues did not come up in any detail, as the conversation largely stayed in the political realm. Nor was China's recent test launching of a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile discussed by the two leaders.———Associated Price writer Ken Moritsugu in Beijing contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "SKOPJE, North Macedonia -- Prime Minister Zoran Zaev announced his resignation late Sunday following the heavy defeat of his governing Social Democratic Union in North Macedonia’s local elections.“The responsibility for this outcome is mine and I’m resigning as prime minister and as leader of the Social Democratic Union,” Zaev said at a news conference at party headquarters.Although official results were not yet in from the local elections, Zaev conceded defeat in the most important contest — the mayor’s race in the capital, Skopje, with incumbent Petre Shilegov losing to a center-right backed challenger, Danela Arsovska. Arsovska will become the capital’s first ever woman mayor.Candidates supported by the main opposition party, the center-right VMRO-DPMNE, appeared set to win at least half of the country’s 80 municipalities, with the Social Democrats set to win fewer than 20. At the last municipal elections, in 2017, the Social Democrats won 57 contests and VMRO-DPMNE only five.Official results were expected Monday.Zaev came out against early national elections, saying he will support a Social Democrat-led government under a new leader.Hristijan Mickoski, the leader of the center-right main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, called for an early parliamentary elections to be held.“The governing party is now delegitimized, and this is a new reality. The best way now are early elections,” Mickoski said, after declaring victory in the local election.The last national election was held in July 2020 and a new one does not have to be held until 2024. But everything will now depend on the country’s Parliament.Under the country’s constitution, the Parliament has to vote to accept Zaev’s resignation, and that is not a given. The governing coalition has a small majority, with 62 seats in the 120-seat Parliament — 46 from the Social Democrat-led “We Can” coalition of 23 parties, 15 belonging to the the country’s largest ethnic Albanian party and one from the Democratic Party of Albanians.VMRO-DPMNE leads the “Renewal” coalition of allied small parties, which has 44 seats, while the Alliance of Albanians has 12 and the fiercely leftist and nationalist Left party has two seats.If Parliament does accept Zaev's resignation, negotiations would begin to form a new Cabinet under a different Social Democrat leader and that could be protracted.This is the first time in North Macedonia’s 30-year history that a prime minister has resigned after a defeat in local elections.During his first term, which lasted from 2017 to 2020, Zaev resolved a long-lasting dispute with Greece of the country's name. Greece said the original name of “Republic of Macedonia” and certain clauses in the country’s constitution implied territorial claims on Greece's northern province of Macedonia.Under the agreement achieved with Greece’s then-leftist government in June 2018, the country changed its name to “North Macedonia” — although its citizens are called “Macedonians” — and amended its constitution in exchange for Greek support for the country’s efforts to join the European Union and NATO. North Macedonia became NATO’s 30th member in March 2020.Greece’s now governing center-right New Democracy party, which opposed the agreement with North Macedonia, has committed to abide by it, but VMRO-DPMNE still strongly opposes it.While in power earlier, VMRO-DPMNE claimed supposed connections with the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia and erected a giant statue of Alexander the Great in the capital of Skopje, even though ethnic Macedonians are Slavs descended from people who came to the region centuries after Alexander.Zaev’s government and the just-defeated mayor of Skopje, took down the statue and other ancient Macedonian symbols.———Associated Press writer Demetris Nellas in Athens, Greece, contributed to this report.",

Images from the protest showed police arresting some protesters. Others suffered injuries.Several hundred people also joined a similar protest in Casablanca, the country’s economic hub. Demonstrators in other cities such as Tangiers in the north and Agadir in the south held similar protests.While Morocco's vaccine passport is required in an unusually large number of places, similar passes are used in many countries and have boosted vaccination rates.

        "Text": "LONDON -- Two passenger trains crashed after one of them derailed in the southern English city of Salisbury, and several people were injured, authorities said Sunday.Network Rail said the rear carriage of a passenger train derailed after “striking an object” as it approached the station at Salisbury, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southwest of London. The derailment “knocked out all of the signaling in the area,” and a second train then collided with the derailed one.“There are reports of injuries and the emergency services are on site along with railway first responders,” Network Rail said.The British Transport Police said there were no fatalities. The police force said “a number of people” were injured in the crash, but it did not give details.Some 50 firefighters rushed to the scene, the Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said.British media reported that all passengers and a driver who was trapped in his cab were evacuated, and the injuries were believed to be minor.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted that the derailment and crash would be investigated.",

        "Page_url": [],
        "Text": "ROME -- Leaders of the world’s biggest economies agreed Sunday to stop funding coal-fired power plants in poor countries and made a vague commitment to seek carbon neutrality “by or around mid-century” as they wrapped up a Rome summit before the much larger United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.While Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and French President Emmanuel Macron described the Group of 20 summit as a success, the outcome disappointed climate activists, the chief of the U.N. and Britain's leader. The U.K. is hosting the two-week Glasgow conference and had looked for more ambitious targets to come out of Rome.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the G-20's commitments mere “drops in a rapidly warming ocean.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed the outcome was not enough.“While I welcome the #G20′s recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled — but at least they are not buried,” Guterres tweeted. “Onwards to #COP26 in Glasgow.\"The G-20 countries represent more than three-quarters of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, and Britain had hoped for a “G-20 bounce\" going into the Glasgow COP26 meeting. Environmentalists and scientists have described the U.N. conference as the world's “last best hope\" for nailing down commitments to limit the global rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average.The summit laid bare the divisions that still exist between Western countries that polluted the planet the most historically but are now seeing emissions decline and the emerging economies led by China whose emissions are rising as their economies grow.Britain pushed for a commitment to achieve climate neutrality or net-zero emissions, meaning a balance between greenhouse gases added to and removed from the atmosphere, by 2050.The United States and the European Union have set 2050 as their own deadline for reaching net-zero emissions, while China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are aiming for 2060. The leaders of those three countries didn’t come to Rome for the summit.In the end, the G-20 leaders arrived at a compromise to achieve climate neutrality “by or around mid-century,” not a set year.Before leaving Rome, U.S. President Joe Biden called it “disappointing’ that G-20 members Russia and China ’basically didn’t show up” with commitments to address the scourge of climate change ahead of the U.N. climate conference.Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are not expected to attend the conference in Glasgow, although they are sending senior officials to the international COP26 talks.“The disappointment relates to the fact that Russia...and China basically didn’t show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change. And there’s a reason why people should be disappointed,” Biden said, adding: “I found it disappointing myself.”Biden comments came in response to a reporter’s question about the modest pledges made during the G-20 summit.“We made commitments here from across the board in terms of what we’re going to bring to (COP26),” the president said. “As that old trade saying goes, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.”Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pushed back at the West's target date.“Why do you believe 2050 is some magic figure?” Lavrov asked at a news conference. “If it is an ambition of the European Union, it is the right of other countries also to have ambitions....No one has proven to us or anybody else that 2050 is something everyone must subscribe to.”Italy's Draghi said the declaration went further on climate than any G-20 statement before it. He noted that it referred to keeping the 1.5-degree global warming target within reach, something that science shows will be hard to accomplish unless the world dramatically cuts emissions from fossil fuels.“We changed the goalposts,” Draghi told reporters.Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau said that G-20 leaders were able to get together was in itself a success given the coronavirus pandemic.“The fact that we have well laid out the table and know where the sharp edges are, and know what work we we’re going to have to do at COP… is a very positive step,” Trudeau said.The future of coal, a key source of greenhouse gas emissions, also proved one of the most difficult issues on which to find consensus for the G-20.At the Rome summit, leaders agreed to “put an end to the provision of international public finance for new unabated coal power generation abroad by the end of 2021.” That refers to financial support for building coal plants abroad.Western countries have been moving away from such financing and major Asian economies are following suit: Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at the U.N. General Assembly last month that Beijing would stop funding such projects, and Japan and South Korea made similar commitments earlier in the year.China has not set an end date for building coal plants at home, however. Coal is still China’s main source of power generation, and both China and India have resisted proposals for a G-20 declaration on phasing out domestic coal consumption.The failure of the G-20 to set a target for phasing out domestic coal use was a disappointment to Britain. But Johnson's spokesperson, Max Blain, said the G-20 communique “was never meant to be the main lever in order to secure commitments on climate change,” noting those would be hammered out at the Glasgow summit.John Kirton, director of the G-20 Research Group at the University of Toronto, said the leaders “took only baby steps” in the agreement and did almost nothing new.He pointed to the agreement to “recall and reaffirm” their overdue commitment to provide $100 billion in assistance to poorer countries and to “stress the importance of meeting that goal fully as soon as possible” instead of stating that they were ready to stump up the full amount.The agreement to end international coal financing “is the one thing that’s specific and real. That one counts,” Kirton said.Youth climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate issued an open letter to the media as the G-20 was wrapping up, stressing three fundamental aspects of the climate crisis that often are downplayed: that time is running out, that any solution must provide justice to the people most affected, and that the biggest polluters often hide behind incomplete statistics about their true emissions.“The climate crisis is only going to become more urgent. We can still avoid the worst consequences, we can still turn this around. But not if we continue like today,” they wrote, just weeks after Thunberg shamed global leaders for their “blah blah blah” rhetoric during a youth climate summit in Milan.Greenpeace Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said the G-20 failed to provide the leadership the world needed. “I think it was a betrayal to young people around the world,” she told The Associated Press on Sunday.Aside from climate issues, the leaders signed off on a landmark agreement for countries to enact a global minimum corporate tax of 15%. The global minimum is aimed at deterring multinational companies from dodging taxes by shifting profits to countries with ultra-low rates where they may do little actual business.The leaders also said they would continue work on a French initiative for wealthier countries to re-channel $100 billion in financial support to needier countries in Africa in the form of special drawing rights - a foreign exchange tool used to help finance imports allocated by the International Monetary Fund and also received by advanced countries.The leaders said they were “working on actionable options” to do that and set the $100 billion figure as a “total global ambition” short of an absolute commitment. Some $45 billion has already been reallocated by individual countries on a voluntary basis.The commitment reflects concern that the post-pandemic recovery is diverging, with wealthy countries rebounding faster due to extensive vaccinations and stimulus spending.——— Associated Press writers Jill Lawless and Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report.

        "Text": "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico returned Sunday to mass commemorations of the Day of the Dead, after traditional visits to graveyards were prohibited last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.But the one-year hiatus showed how the tradition itself refuses to die: Most families still celebrated with home altars to deceased loved ones, and some snuck into cemeteries anyway.Gerardo Tapia Guadarrama on Sunday joined many others at the cemetery as he visited the grave of his father Juan Ignacio Tapia, who died in May 2020 of a thrombosis.Even though cemeteries in Mexico were closed to visitors last year to avoid spreading the virus, so strong is the tradition that his son still slipped into the cemetery in the eastern Mexico City suburb of Valle de Chalco to visit him.’Lat year it was prohibited, but we found a way,\" Tapia Guadarrama said slyly. Much of graveyard has low walls that can be jumped.“To live is to remember,” he said. “What they (the dead) most want want is a visit from those they were close to in life.\"The holiday begins Oct. 31, remembering those who died in accidents; it continues Nov. 1 to mark those died in childhood, and then those who died as adults on Nov. 2.Observances include entire families cleaning and decorating graves, which are covered with orange marigolds. At both cemeteries and at home altars, relatives light candles, put out offerings of the favorite foods and beverages of their deceased relatives.There was a special altar in downtown Mexico City dedicated to those who died of COVID-19. Relatives were allowed into a fenced-off plaza and offered equipment to print out photos of their loved ones, which they could then pin, along with handwritten, messages on a black wall.It was a quiet, solemn remembrance in a country where coronavirus deaths touched almost all extended families.Mexico has over 288,000 test-confirmed deaths, but probable coronavirus mortalities as listed on death certificates suggest a toll closer to 440,000, by some counts the fourth-highest in the world.For a country where people usually die surrounded by relatives, COVID-19 was particularly cruel, as loved ones were taken off alone in plastic tents, to die alone in isolation.“The only thing I could say to him was, ‘Do everything the doctors tell you,’” Gina Olvera said of her father, who died of coronavirus. “That was the last thing I was able to say to him.” Olvera said she told her father, as she taped his photo to the memorial, “Well, you didn't make it, but you are here with us.”One woman wept as she pinned up a photo of a female relative. Another, Dulce Moreno, was calm but sad as she pinned up a photo of her uncle and her grandfather, Pedro Acosta Nuñez, both of whom died of complications of COVID-19.“The house feels empty now without him (the grandfather), we feel lost,” Moreno said.For most, it was a joyful return, above all, to public activities like public altars and the Hollywood-style Day of the Dead parade that Mexico City adopted to mimic a fictitious march in the 2015 James Bond movie “Spectre.”“These days are not sad here; they are a way to remember our dead with great happiness,” said Otilia Ochoa, a homemaker who came along with dozens of others to take pictures of the flower-decked offerings near the coronavirus memorial. “What is good is to recover this liberty, this contact we had lost” during the pandemic, Ochoa said.Tens of thousands of Mexico City — almost all wearing masks, despite the city's relatively high vaccination rate — gathered along the city's main boulevard Sunday to watch the parade of dancing skeletons, dancers and floats.There were few references to coronavirus in the parade, but there was a whole section of skeleton-dressed actors representing Mexico City's street traders and vendors.“We are here to celebrate life!” Mexico City Tourism Secretary Paola Felix Diaz said in kicking off the parade.More risky group activities like Halloween-style costume parties and trick-or-treating have still not recovered from the pandemic. But children took the opportunity to dress up in Mexico-style Day of the Dead costumes as skull-like Catrinas, or as red-clad guards from the Netflix series “Squid Game.”But Mexico has long had a different attitude toward death, more social, more accepting than in many parts of the world. Wakes and funerals here are often elaborate, days-long events gathering entire neighborhoods and extended families for eating, praying and remembering.",
